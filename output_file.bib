	abstract = {Hypothesis development is a complex cognitive activity, but one that is critical as a means of reducing uncertainty during ill-structured problem solving. In this study, we examined the effect of metacognitive scaffolds in strengthening hypothesis development. We also examined the influence of hypothesis development on young adolescents' problem-solving performance. Data was collected from sixth-grade students (N = 172) using a computer-supported problem-based learning environment, Animal Investigator. The findings of the study indicated that participants using metacognitive scaffolds developed significantly better hypotheses and that hypothesis-development performance was predictive of solution-development performance. This article discusses further educational implications of the findings and future research. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In our previous project, an XML-based authoring tool was provided for teachers to script multimedia teaching material with animated agents, and a stand-alone learning system was designed for students to display the material and interact with animated agents. We also provided evidence that the authoring tool and learning system in computer-assisted learning systems successfully enhances learning performance. The aim of this study is to continue the previous project, to develop a Web-based multimedia learning system that presents materials and an animated agent on a Web browser. The Web-based multimedia learning system can provide an opportunity for students to engage in independent learning or review of school course work. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of this learning system, it was applied to one elementary school. An experimental material, 'Road Traffic Safety', was presented in two learning systems: aWeb-based PowerPoint learning system and a Web-based multimedia learning system. The experiment was carried out in two classes that had a total of thirtyone 3rd-grade students. The results suggest that using our authoring tool in a Web-based learning system can improve learning, and in particular, enhance learners' problem-solving ability. Students with higher achievement on the post-test showed better comprehension in problem-solving questions. Furthermore, the feedback from the questionnaire surveys show students' learning interest can be fostered when an animated agent is integrated into multimedia teaching materials, and that students prefer to adopt the Web-based multimedia learning system for independent learning after school. © 2011 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

	abstract = {A generic interactive multimedia e-leaming system (IMELS) for industrial engineering that uses a problem-based learning approach is developed. The system is designed to be a learning shell with an open architecture for the hosting and delivery of knowledge, case problems and other web-based material in industrial engineering. This problem-based e-learning system is designed to revitalize the teaching/learning process of industrial engineering and to create a learning platform that overcomes the boundaries of space and time. A number of configurable modules are introduced, including a multimedia introduction to industrial engineering, an electronics knowledgebase, and a platform that facilitates interactive problem-based learning through realistic case problems. As the principal objectives of the system are to use the computer-based materials with conventional teaching, and as an up-to-date repository for practitioners in the field, an architecture that accommodates flexible re-configuration, building-up of new information and updating existing materials is provided. This paper presents the design of the IMELS with special focuses on the architecture of the 'virtual company' that supports the problem-based learning paradigm, facilitates dynamic reconfiguration and tracking of student learning activities. © 2005 TEMPUS Publications.},

Participants were presented with a scenario and provided with relevant and irrelevant information to solve the task. Participants could access the information in any order and attempt to solve the problem at any time. The most frequently occurring cognitive processes were paraphrasing text, accurate cause-effect inferences, and monitoring of problem solving behavior. Productive processes were related to success and consistent with scientific reasoning behavior on the task and unproductive processes were related to unsuccessful performance and consistent with poor reasoning. We found strong evidence of the cognitive validity of the IMMEX task. Components of an online process-based assessment testbed are identified. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Learning through problem solving has been widely adopted as an effective learning paradigm in challenging domains such as medical education. For effective learning through practical experience, problem solving and knowledge construction should be highly integrated and reciprocally reinforcing. However, both knowledge construction and problem solving are complex cognitive processes, which cannot be easily captured and mastered. Temporal problem-solving experience can be forgotten, and knowledge embedded in problem-solving experience may not be transferable to new problems. This study aimed to address the challenge via proposing a computer-based learning environment, where a visualization-based cognitive tool was designed to make thinking and learning in a problem context visible and to connect problem-solving and knowledge-construction activities throughout the learning process. An online learning program using the proposed learning environment was delivered to thirty-five students from two medical schools. The design of the proposed learning environment and its effects on problem-based learning are examined with implications for further studies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

As such, many institutions are moving towards problem-based learning as a solution to producing graduates who are creative, can think critically and analytically, and are able to solve problems. In this paper, we focus on using multimedia technology as an innovative teaching and learning strategy in a problem-based learning environment by giving the students a multimedia project to train them in this skill set. The purpose of this project was to access the students' skills in framing and solving problems using multimedia technologies. The students worked in groups and each group had to pick a topic for their project, develop, design and present it in a CD-ROM. They were then surveyed on their attitudes toward the project and their skills as a team. Results showed that the students were very positive toward the project, enjoyed teamwork, able to think critically and became active participants in their learning process. Therefore, multimedia-oriented projects, like many other problem-based learning solutions, can be used alternatively as an innovative and effective tool in a problem-based learning environment for the acquisition of problem-solving skills.},

	abstract = {Blended learning has become an increasingly popular form of e-learning, and is particularly suitable to the process of transitioning towards e-learning from traditional forms of learning and teaching. This paper describes the use of the blended e-learning model, which is based on a mixture of collaborative learning, problem-based learning (PBL) and independent learning, in a course "Teaching Methods in Information Science,"given at the University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia. This model is realized as a combination of a face-to-face environment and online learning, using a proprietary learning management system (LMS) named adaptive hypermedia courseware (AHyCo). AHyCo is based on adaptive hypermedia and in addition to supporting learning and testing, introduces completely new constructivist and cognitivist elements to education. By supporting collaborative and project-oriented activities AHyCo promotes students' motivation for learning and establishes learning as an active and interactive process. This paper describes both the technology for, and the methodological approach to, course design and development which is aimed at supporting the evolution from traditional teaching to active learning, and raising interest in the topics of e-learning and Web courseware development among IT students. A survey conducted in the end of the course showed that students were satisfied with the pedagogical approach, and their academic achievements were also better than expected. Particularly important is that the dropout rate was greatly diminished, which could be related to students' satisfaction with the support they received from the instructor and the system. © 2008 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Multimedia data and application systems accessible over the Web are valuable assets for developing instructional materials for teaching, training, problem solving, and decision support. These assets can be used to construct learning objects, each of which is a reusable granule of instruction designed to meet a specific instructional objective. In order to find and use learning objects, an infrastructure for the registration, discovery, binding, and invocation of these objects is needed. Also, there is a need for an e-learning service infrastructure for people in a virtual e-learning community to construct, evaluate, and deliver learning objects. In this work, we model distributed and sharable learning resources by two types of Learning Objects (LOs): Atomic Learning Object and Composite Learning Object. Both types of LOs are published uniformly as Web services in a constraint-based broker in order to make them sharable and reusable. Tins article presents the learning object models for the specifications of these two types of LOs and an e-learning service infrastructure, which consists of authoring tools for constructing LOs, software components for processing LOs and performing assessments, and an extended Web services framework for the registration, discovery, binding, and invocation of LOs as Web services. This article also presents techniques such as dynamic binding of LOs, rule-based execution of learning processes, and model-based assessment used to make the processing of LOs active, flexible, customizable, and adaptive. The roles and functions of virtual e-learning community members are also discussed. Copyright © 2006, Idea Group Inc.},

	abstract = {Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is a critical competency for the modern workforce, as many of todays' problems require groups to come together to find innovative solutions to complex problems. This has motivated increased interest in work dedicated to assessing and developing CPS skills. However, there has been limited attention in prior CPS assessment research on potential differences in how CPS behaviors are exhibited across task contexts. In the current study, we investigated associations among middle- and high-school students’ displayed CPS skills across two online (i.e., via videoconferencing) tasks (Physics Playground and the T-Shirt Math Task) and the extent to which different skills were related to CPS outcomes across those tasks. Results showed variation in associations of CPS skills across the tasks, contributing further evidence to our understanding of how different CPS task designs can give students the opportunity to demonstrate different CPS skills. Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating multiple tasks during CPS assessments and can inform future research on CPS task design and computer-based CPS assessment. © 2023},

	abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a concept used as a systemtic way of thinking and in problem-solving process, not just for computer science but other domains of knowledge. Various research conducted at high school and tertiary levels of education has shown that CT integrated into lessons across STEM have shown positive results. This study conducted at elementary school integrates CT with the Design and Technology (RBT) subject particularly in the Visual-Based Project Production Package Model (VB-P3) across STEM, using computational thinking skills, in the Energy Efficient i-Agro Reservoir Crop System (EE i-Agro) project production process for the Design and Technology (RBT) subject in primary schools. This package is aimed at improving students’ problem-solving and thinking skills by making them more creative and innovative. The VB-P3 also includes the development of RBT Energy Efficient i-Agro learning model and modules (EEi-Agro LMM). The VB-P3 model was based on the ‘prototyping’ iterative model comprising of five (5) main phases; namely analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation with appropriate iteration. This model is also based on the COMEL learning model with attributes such as interactivity, fun learning, engaging and motivating, which helps students’ learning, with additional components and elements. Hence, this paper highlights the evaluation of the Visual-Based Project Production Package Development (VB-P3) model to develop the Energy Efficient i-Agro Reservoir Crop System (EE i-Agro) Project which can improve thinking and problem-solving skills, to prepare students for the new learning environment and instill sustainability practices in students facing energy transition, climate change and global warming experienced globally. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {Identification of the optimal subset of features for Feature Selection (FS) problems is a demanding problem in machine learning and data mining. A trustworthy optimization approach is required to cope with the concerns involved in such a problem. Here, a Binary version of the Capuchin Search Algorithm (CSA), referred to as BCSA, was developed to select the optimal feature combination. Owing to the imbalance of parameters and random nature of BCSA, it may sometimes fall into the trap of an issue called local maxima. To beat this problem, the BCSA could be further improved with the resettlement of its individuals by adopting some methods of repopulating the individuals during foraging. Lévy flight was applied to augment the exploitation and exploration abilities of BCSA, a method referred to as LBCSA. A Chaotic strategy is used to reinforce search behavior for both exploration and exploitation potentials of BCSA, which is referred to as CBCSA. Finally, Lévy flight and chaotic sequence are integrated with BCSA, referred to as LCBCSA, to increase solution diversity and boost the openings of finding the global optimal solutions. The proposed methods were assessed on twenty-six datasets collected from the UCI repository. The results of these methods were compared with those of other FS methods. Overall results show that the proposed methods render more precise solutions in terms of accuracy rates and fitness scores than other methods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Rural students' lack of access to high-quality educational resources leads to lagging academic achievement and a deficiency in 21st-century skills. Smart classrooms integrate advanced technology to provide equitable digital learning and interactive environments for these students. However, determining optimal pedagogical approaches for smart classrooms and investigating the potential technology novelty effect remain areas of exploration. This study delved into the impact of smart classrooms combined with various student-centered pedagogies (SC-SCP)—team-based learning (TBL), problem-based learning (PBL), and project-based learning (PjBL), on rural students' learning outcomes. These outcomes encompassed academic achievement, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. Additionally, the research examined how student-centered pedagogies and intervention duration moderated the effects of SC-SCP. A meta-analysis across 24 rural schools in Taiwan was conducted, each with a comparison class and an experimental class, resulting in a total of 48 classes. While the comparison classes within traditional classrooms combined with teacher-centered pedagogies (TC-TCP), the experimental classes embraced SC-SCP in smart classrooms. The findings indicate that: 1) The experimental classes outperformed the comparison classes in enhancing students’ learning outcomes; 2) when considering the moderating impact of student-centered pedagogies, PjBL exhibited the most substantial improvement in problem-solving skills, followed by PBL, and finally TBL; additionally, 3) SC-SCP demonstrated a minor improvement effect size in problem-solving skills after four weeks of intervention, which escalated to a significant effect size after eight weeks of intervention. In summary, these results suggest that a combination of smart classrooms and PjBL, implemented for a duration of over two months, leads to the most substantial enhancement in learning outcomes for rural students. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Traditionally, doctoral student education in the biomedical sciences relies on didactic coursework to build a foundation of scientific knowledge and an apprenticeship model of training in the laboratory of an established investigator. Recent recommendations for revision of graduate training include the utilization of graduate student competencies to assess progress and the introduction of novel curricula focused on development of skills, rather than accumulation of facts. Evidence demonstrates that active learning approaches are effective. Several facets of active learning are components of problem-based learning (PBL), which is a teaching modality where student learning is self-directed toward solving problems in a relevant context. These concepts were combined and incorporated in creating a new introductory graduate course designed to develop scientific skills (student competencies) in matriculating doctoral students using a PBL format. Methods: Evaluation of course effectiveness was measured using the principals of the Kirkpatrick Four Level Model of Evaluation. At the end of each course offering, students completed evaluation surveys on the course and instructors to assess their perceptions of training effectiveness. Pre- and post-tests assessing students’ proficiency in experimental design were used to measure student learning. Results: The analysis of the outcomes of the course suggests the training is effective in improving experimental design. The course was well received by the students as measured by student evaluations (Kirkpatrick Model Level 1). Improved scores on post-tests indicate that the students learned from the experience (Kirkpatrick Model Level 2). A template is provided for the implementation of similar courses at other institutions. Conclusions: This problem-based learning course appears effective in training newly matriculated graduate students in the required skills for designing experiments to test specific hypotheses, enhancing student preparation prior to initiation of their dissertation research. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: In medical education, the conventional didactic lectures make the learning process tedious and cause disinterest among students. To overcome this, an effective experiential learning integrated with game-based approach that intends to make the learning process fun filled, interesting and enhance the active participation of students to understand complex topics in a simple and optimum manner should be adopted. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to assess the efficiency of a puzzle-based innovation, METAPAD (METAbolic PAthways Decoded) in understanding the complexity of biochemical pathways by enhancing the self-directed learning of students through active engagement in small groups Methods: In this mixed-method study, 103 first professional year medical students in small groups were enrolled for the METAPAD gaming puzzle-based learning activity. The puzzles were integrated with a relevant clinical case study. Decoding the puzzle after identification of the metabolic pathway involved in the case was conducted in level 1,2 and 3 with increasing complexity of puzzles at every level. Following the puzzle activity, A 21-item questionnaire was administered to evaluate the usefulness of the innovation and students’ perceptions towards different learning styles. Also, students’ feedback was obtained through personal interviews for qualitative analysis and thematic analysis was performed. Results: One hundred and three first year undergraduate medical students participated in the study. Most of the students perceived the METAPAD gaming puzzle to be an effective and innovative style of learning. There was not any significant association between age, gender and acceptance towards the METAPAD gaming puzzle. The predominant type of learning style among the students was multimodal (49.5%). Also, there was no great influence of the learning styles on the overall perception towards the METAPAD gaming puzzle. However, learners emphasized the need to focus more while solving the puzzles. Conclusion: Students perceive the METAPAD gaming puzzle as an actively engaging teaching-learning method that enhances their creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. It promotes self-directed learning of complex pathways in biochemistry which helps in remembering and recalling information and improves their learning skills. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), it is challenging for a collection of agents to learn complex temporally extended tasks. The difficulties lie in computational complexity and how to learn the high-level ideas behind reward functions. We study the graph-based Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the dynamics of neighboring agents are coupled. To learn complex temporally extended tasks, we use a reward machine (RM) to encode each agent's task and expose reward function internal structures. RM has the capacity to describe high-level knowledge and encode non-Markovian reward functions. We propose a decentralized learning algorithm to tackle computational complexity, called decentralized graph-based reinforcement learning using reward machines (DGRM), that equips each agent with a localized policy, allowing agents to make decisions independently based on the information available to the agents. DGRM uses the actor-critic structure, and we introduce the tabular Q-function for discrete state problems. We show that the dependency of the Q-function on other agents decreases exponentially as the distance between them increases. To further improve efficiency, we also propose the deep DGRM algorithm, using deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function and policy function to solve large-scale or continuous state problems. The effectiveness of the proposed DGRM algorithm is evaluated by three case studies, two wireless communication case studies with independent and dependent reward functions, respectively, and COVID-19 pandemic mitigation.

There are a variety of LWE-solving methods, which can be classified into four groups: lattice methods, algebraic methods, combinatorial methods, and exhaustive searching. The Blum–Kalai–Wasserman (BKW) algorithm is an important variety of combinatorial algorithms, which was first presented for solving the Learning Parity With Noise (LPN) problem and then extended to solve LWE. In this paper, we give an overview of BKW algorithms for solving LWE. We introduce the framework and key techniques of BKW algorithms and make comparisons between different BKW algorithms and also with lattice methods by estimating concrete security of specific LWE instances. We also briefly discuss the current problems and potential future directions of BKW algorithms. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study analyzed the effects of virtual reality simulation-based problem-based learning on nursing students’ critical thinking ability, problem-solving ability, and self-efficacy in the nursing care of women undergoing induction of labor. Methods: A nonequivalent control group pretest and posttest design was employed. The study participants included 52 nursing students (24 in the experimental group and 28 in the control group). The experimental group took a problem-based learning (PBL) class in the first week, and then engaged in self-directed learning using virtual reality simulation. In the second week, lectures about emergency nursing care for induction of labor and drug administration were given. The control group participated in PBL in the first week and lectures in the second week. The study was conducted from April 17 to May 19, 2023. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test, Fisher exact test, analysis of variance, and the independent t-test. Results: Before-and-after differences between the two groups were statistically significant in problem solving ability (t=–5.47, p<.001) and self-efficacy (t=–5.87, p<.001). Critical thinking ability did not show a statistically significant difference between the two groups. The score for satisfaction with the virtual reality simulation program was 3.64±5.88 out of 5 in the experimental group. Conclusion: PBL education using a virtual reality simulation was found to be an effective way of teaching. Although convenience sampling was used, PBL education using virtual reality can be used as an educational strategy to enhance nursing students’ problem-solving ability and self-efficacy. © 2023 Korean Society of Women Health Nursing.},

Background: The teaching-learning process has undergone significant changes in recent years with the proposal of the flipped classroom strategy, which places the student at the center of the learning process and uses technology that requires adaptation of lecturers, both inside and outside the classroom. Pre-class learning material is one of the features of the flipped classroom model. It provides basic concepts for problem solving in small group discussion in classroom. Podcasts for this educational purpose are a recent technology and their innovative characteristics require deeper understanding in terms of their influence and usability. Design: Prospective, descriptive and quantitative study. Setting and Population: A workshop on the production of educational podcasts was offered to 23 lecturers on the Nursing course. Methods: Data were collected in the second semester of 2021 and the quality analysis was based on criteria available in the literature. Results: Eighteen professors (78 %) participated in the study and 46 podcasts were produced. Most professors being nurses (61 %), followed by biologists (28 %). Most have a doctorate degree (72 %). These podcasts were available for a mean of five days before the classes and their mean access rate by students was 58 %. There was no correlation between the access rate and the period of availability before the relative class. Most podcasts were informative (100 %) and monologues (98 %). The average duration was 6.2 min, which is within the ideal duration recommended in the literature. All of the podcasts included a description of the learning objectives at the beginning and most of them also included a closing message at the end. Conclusion: The nursing lecturers were able to produce their podcasts, which met quality criteria and reached the standards suggested by experts in the field. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Application-of-knowledge skills are highly valued in clinical medicine, as indicated by recent changes to licensure and entrance exams for nursing and physician programs (i.e., the NCLEX and MCAT). Such emphasis should be both welcomed and supported by approaches to teaching human anatomy and physiology that emphasize critical thinking skills built upon logic, reasoning, and judgment. The argument for development of these skills is not simply philosophical. Rather, such emphasis is strongly supported by a 2016 Johns Hopkins study (Makary MA, Daniel M. BMJ 353: i2139, 2016) that estimates that medical errors are now the third leading cause of death in the United States! Active learning techniques known to require critical thinking skills are often supplemental to standard expository lecturing or other avenues of imparting content knowledge (reading, videos, etc.). We propose that all content dissemination can and should provide for the development of critical thinking skills, preparing students for active learning techniques requiring this ability. This can be accomplished by establishing an intellectual framework for understanding the adaptive benefits of anatomical or physiological traits. Additionally, explanations conveying the causality of mechanistic sequences result in learning content within intuitive functional groups rather than as isolated phenomena, the latter often accomplished mainly through memorization as opposed to real understanding. Here, we provide a template for lecture development based upon these principles as well as a specific example from human anatomy and physiology. Our hope is to provide a model for how students should think about all physiology, making comprehensive coverage of content (an impossible task!) much less important.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Critical thinking skills are essential to the effective performance of many careers, particularly those involving health care. To aid the development of these skills in physiology, the formation of logical cognitive frameworks needs to be supported via instruction that emphasizes the context of physiological functions (the "why") as well as the causality of their sequential actions. Within such frameworks, students become capable of cognitive reasoning required to reach intuitive conclusions after system perturbations.},

	abstract = {Background: Medical education has evolved rapidly, with the development of flipped classrooms and team-based learning based on lecture-based learning, but the novel model of combining flipped classrooms with team-based learning has been poorly investigated in orthopedic education. Methods: A femoral neck fracture teaching mode was chosen to 109 clinical internship students to explore the effectiveness of flipped classroom combined with team-based learning in internship education. They were enrolled and randomly divided into either the flipped classroom combined with team-based learning group (FTG, n = 55) or the traditional lecture-based classroom group (n = 54). All students completed the learning according to the course flow and took before-class and after-class tests. The questionnaires were used to compare students perceptions and satisfaction with the different teaching methods and were utilized to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the 2 groups. Results: The post-class test scores of both groups significantly improved compared to pre-class test scores. Regarding the post-class test scores, FTG's was significantly higher than the traditional lecture-based classroom group's, mainly in clinical areas such as imaging analysis, fracture classification, treatment options, and management of postoperative complications, but there was no significant difference in the mastery of basic theoretical knowledge. The students were more satisfied with the FTG and believed that it improved their various competencies, but with significantly more time spent. Conclusion: FTG is generally recognized as a promising option for training clinical interns and is worth spreading as it has outstanding merits in developing students clinical competence. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Currently, there is a gap in resident participation in patient safety event analyses. The objective was to develop and implement a sustainable, faculty-led curriculum for resident participation in patient safety event investigations and to evaluate resident perceptions of the training at least one year following completion of the training. One hundred sixty-five residents from three specialties participated in a formal RCA2 training curriculum from 2013 to 2019. In November 2019, the same residents were asked to complete a survey which examined their perception of the training including the tools and techniques such as event mapping, cause-and-effect diagramming, and developing action plans for solving problems and unsafe conditions. The survey response rate was 36 % (60/165). Sixty-three percent (38/60) of the residents responding to the survey believed that RCA2 training should be provided to all residents. Former residents rated the RCA2 training tools and skills favorably, 3.6 median score (3.5–3.7, 95 % C.I.). Forty-eight percent of responding residents (29/60) believed that the previous RCA2 training improved the way they identify and solve problems. The curriculum and faculty development program provides an effective intervention to address the current, identified gaps in patient safety in graduate medical education. © 2023},

Physiology is a basic medical course that studies the phenomena and laws of human life activities, and is a crucial link course connecting preclinical courses and clinical courses. However, there is a paucity of data showing the effectiveness of the flipped classroom model for the entirety of physiology course in medical undergraduate students. Method: 131 sophomore students with clinical medicine major at Harbin Medical University were recruited and they were randomly allocated into two groups: the control group which was subjected to traditional lecture teaching (n = 69), and the experimental group which was subjected to flipped classroom teaching (n = 62). To assess the effect of flipped teaching, the usual performance and final exam scores were used to evaluate the physiology learning effectiveness of students. The correlation between the usual performance and final exam scores by Pearson method was also conducted in the two teaching groups. After course completion, an anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted among the subjects of flipped classroom group to assess students’ opinion regarding the flipped classroom teaching. Results: Our results showed that the usual performance and final exam scores of students in the flipped classroom were both significantly higher than that in the traditional teaching class (P < 0.05). Moreover, our results also showed that the usual performance of students was significantly correlated with the final exam scores in the flipped classroom (r = 0.3945, P < 0.01), but not in the traditional teaching group (r = 0.1522, P = 0.2119). The results of questionnaire survey showed that 77.58% of the students believed flipped classroom teaching improved their knowledge acquisition. 70%~86% of students perceived that flipped classroom enhanced their learning abilities, including self-study ability, collaborative learning and problem-solving skills, and clinical thinking ability. In addition, about 60% of students acknowledged the teaching design and teaching environment, more students’ engagement and presentation of group learning in the flipped classroom. Conclusion: The flipped classroom teaching significantly improved students’ learning effectiveness in physiology course, as indicated by final exam score and usual performance. It also promoted higher-order ability-set acquisition and allowed a rationalized formative evaluation system. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Problem-based learning (PBL) is an instructional approach that is organized around the investigation and resolution of problems. Problems are neither uniform nor similar. Jonassen (1997, 2000) in his design theory of problem solving has categorized problems into two broad types - well-structured and ill-structured. He has also described a host of mediating skills that impact problem solving outcomes. The thrust of this paper rests in the argument that the basis of these mediating skills is information search literacy and particularly, in view of the utility of the Internet as an informational repository, effective information searching skills. This study was an investigation of how different Internet information seeking strategies can be used to engage in problem solving. A conceptual framework that explains how different Internet information searching strategies can be employed in successfully solving well and ill-structured problems was devised and empirically tested. The research site was a newly established polytechnic in Singapore that employs problem-based learning to support its curricular implementation. The sample population of students came from a class of 25 first-year students. The research findings of this study inform that information searching skills indeed play an important role in problem solving. The findings affirm the need for students to be systematically instructed in the skills of information searching to be able to accomplish problem solving. The information searching necessary for solving well-structured problems is constrained and readily manageable. Thus, students only have to be acquainted with fundamental information searching skills to solve well-structured problems. On the other hand, the information needs of ill-structured problems are usually complex, multi-disciplinary and expansive. Hence, students have to be trained to apply a more advanced set of information searching skills in resolving ill-structured problems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

More specifically, this study attempts to investigate whether there is a gender difference in terms of students' reflective thinking skills towards problem solving. This triangulation study was conducted with 32 primary school students. The quantitative part of the study was conducted in pre-test/post-test comparison design of quasi-experimental design. The scores of reflective problem solving skills were gathered through the reflective thinking skill scale towards problem solving and the students' performances in the code-org site were examined. In the qualitative part of the research, after the five-week experimental process, focus group interviews were conducted with ten students and a reflection paper from the IT teacher was analysed. According to the t-test results, teaching programming to primary school students in the code.org site did not cause any differences in reflective thinking skills towards problem solving. However, there is a slight increment in the means of female students' reflective thinking skills towards problem solving over the males' reflective thinking skills towards problem solving. On the other hand, qualitative data provided more information about the students' experiences. Students developed a positive attitude towards programming, and female students showed that they were as successful as their male counterparts, and that programming could be part of their future plans. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this study, a teaching approach involving a digital escape room (DER) was introduced into science teaching for fourth-graders in elementary school to investigate the effect of this method on students’ learning performance, learning motivation, and problem-solving ability. Based on a quasi-experimental approach, four research tools were applied with 40 students: Science Learning Performance, the Learning Motivation Scale (LMS), the Test of Problem Solving (TPS), and a feedback form. The students were split into an experimental group and a comparison group, with 20 students in each group. The experimental group received the experimental teaching for a 10-week period, during which seven DERs were infused into the science teaching activities, while the comparison group's classes used direct teaching methods. In each class infused with DER activity, the students used tablets to receive and complete tasks by using props, riddles, clues, crossword games, and puzzle challenges within a 25-min window according to the teacher's instructions. The data were analyzed with ANCOVA. The results showed that the students in the experimental group had higher learning motivation and problem-solving ability scores than those in the comparison group. However, the two groups had the same learning performance levels in science class. In general, the students had positive perceptions of the DER experience, and they believed the DER teaching strategy was compelling and effective. Finally, suggestions based on this research study's results are offered with the hope of providing references for teaching practice and future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The industrial revolution era 4.0 has now become a major topic in every country. Various sectors respond quickly to this problem, including education. In response to this, there are several aspects of skills that students must master. One of them is problem-solving skills. One of the aspects that influence the students' problem-solving skills is the context and problem-based learning model. The purpose of this study is to describe the effect of the model on students' skills to solve physics problems. The research method used is a quasi-experimental research design with non-equivalent control group design. The data analysis technique used Independent Sample T-Test by PASW 18 with a significance 5%. Based on the results of the Independent Sample T-Test can be concluded that there is an effect on the model that was applied with a significant gain of 0,00. The results showed that the context and problem-based learning (C-PBL) model affected the physics problem-solving skills. The C-PBL model is able to improve the students' physics problem-solving skills, communication skills, the students' confidence in learning, as well as improving students' understanding of physics lessons conceptually. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness digital game-based learning (DGBL) on students' problem solving, learning motivation.; academic achievement. In order to provide substantive empirical evidence, a quasi-experimental design was implemented over the course of a full semester (23 weeks). Two ninth-grade Civics and Society classes, with a total of 44 students (15-16 years old), were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: an experimental group (incorporating DGBL) and a comparison group (taught using traditional instruction). Two-way mixed ANOVA was employed to evaluate changes in problem solving ability and compare the effectiveness the two strategies, while ANCOVA was used to analyze the effects on learning motivation and academic achievement. The results of this study are summarized as follows: (1) The DGBL strategy was clearly effective in promoting students' problem solving skills, while the control group showed no improvement. Additionally, data from the mid-test and post-test demonstrate that, as a higher order thinking skill, problem-solving requires a full semester to develop. (2). DGBL resulted in better learning motivation for students in the experimental group as compared to learners receiving TI. (3) Contrary to some suggestions that digital games could inhibit academic achievement, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups. Most importantly, the quantitative improvement in problem-solving and learning motivation suggest that DGBL can be exploited as a useful and productive tool to support students in effective learning while enhancing the classroom atmosphere. Future research in DGBL should emphasize the evaluation of other higher order elements of the cognitive domain in terms of academic achievement outcomes and skills, such as critical and creative thinking. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Collaborative skills and problem-solving are seen as fundamental skills for achieving 21st-century skills as a whole. This study aims to develop collaborative problem-solving based on mobile multimedia (CPMM) to achieve student collaborative and problem-solving skills. Multimedia development life cycle (MDLC) is used as a research method to develop CPMM. The CPMM was developed by involving 100 students at the Universitas Muhammadiyah Surabaya, Indonesia. The CPMM development result consisted of three main features. The first feature was the homepage which was used to show student profiles and progress in the course. The second feature was collaborative to become a forum for students to discuss and interact in multi-way mobile ways to solve problems. The third feature was evaluation as tasks from a lecturer to individual students to solve problems. In addition, the study results showed that CPMM was valid and effective for improving students' collaborative and problem-solving skills. This study recommends that CPMM can be used as an essential study and the basis for lecturers and practitioners to develop 21stcentury student skills as a whole (not only collaborative and problem-solving skills) to produce graduates who are ready to face the revolutionary era 4.0. © 2021.

	abstract = {The primary objective of this research was the development of a problem-based learning model using a virtual learning environment (VLE) for undergraduate students in the Photography for Communication Arts course. The model supports and enhances students' learning, achievements and problem-solving skills. An efficiency test for the model revealed an above average set of criteria at 80/83.93, which conformed to the research hypothesis. The principles of instructional systems design (ISD) and systems approach were integrated into the design and assessment phases of model development, which resulted in more effective management of relevant instructional courses and materials. Based on its efficiency and potential application to real-life situations, the model has been deemed suitable by experts. The selected student group in the problem-based learning model via VLE achieved higher test scores compared to a group of students in a normal classroom with a statistical significance of.05. Because students learn using models that promote self-awareness and make it possible to choose their own topic of study employing resources provided by VLE, an assessment of their work quality found that they gained more knowledge of information technology as well as access to up-to-date information. Students are able to choose the most comfortable time to study. The model encourages students to learn through participation, practice problem-solving skills on an individual basis, and exchange ideas with other members of a group. The virtual environment involves many forms of media and materials that stimulate students' interest in learning and results in higher satisfaction. The gap in the communication channel between students and teachers is reduced due to easier and more informal communication. © 2017 Kasetsart University},

	abstract = {Background: Problem-based learning (PBL) is a method widely used in nursing education to develop students' critical thinking skills to solve practice problems independently. Although PBL has been used in nursing education in Korea for nearly a decade, few studies have examined its effects on Korean nursing students' learning outcomes, and few Korean studies have examined relationships among these outcomes. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to examine outcome abilities including critical thinking, problem-solving, and self-directed learning of nursing students receiving PBL vs. traditional lecture, and to examine correlations among these outcome abilities. Design: A quasi-experimental non-equivalent group pretest-posttest design was used. Participants/Setting: First-year nursing students (N. = 90) were recruited from two different junior colleges in two cities (GY and GJ) in South Korea. Methods: In two selected educational programs, one used traditional lecture methods, while the other used PBL methods. Standardized self-administered questionnaires of critical thinking, problem-solving, and self-directed learning abilities were administered before and at 16. weeks (after instruction). Results: Learning outcomes were significantly positively correlated, however outcomes were not statistically different between groups. Students in the PBL group improved across all abilities measured, while student scores in the traditional lecture group decreased in problem-solving and self-directed learning. Critical thinking was positively associated with problem-solving and self-directed learning (r= .71, and r= .50, respectively, p< .001); problem-solving was positively associated with self-directed learning (r= .75, p< .001). Conclusion: Learning outcomes of PBL were not significantly different from traditional lecture in this small underpowered study, despite positive trends. Larger studies are recommended to study effects of PBL on critical student abilities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper details the results of the first phase of a project using eLearning to support students' learning within a simulated environment. The locus was a purpose built clinical simulation laboratory (CSL) where the School's philosophy of problem based learning (PBL) was challenged through lecturers using traditional teaching methods. The solution: a student-centred, problem based approach to the acquisition of clinical skills that used high quality learning objects embedded within web pages, substituting for lecturers providing instruction and demonstration. This encouraged student nurses to explore, analyse and make decisions within the safety of a clinical simulation. Learning was facilitated through network communications and reflection on video performances of self and others. Evaluations were positive, students demonstrating increased satisfaction with PBL, improved performance in exams, and increased self-efficacy in the performance of nursing activities. These results indicate that eLearning techniques can help students acquire clinical skills in the safety of a simulated environment within the context of a problem based learning curriculum. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {Immersive virtual reality (IVR) technology has demonstrated positive educational outcomes related to its use and is gaining traction in educational and training settings; IVR is expected to have widespread adoption within the classroom in the upcoming years. However, the educational potential of IVR with children has not been thoroughly investigated, especially as a tool for problem-solving skills. Therefore, this study was designed to answer the following questions: (1) Is IVR a useful tool to learn and practice problem-solving skills? More specifically, do children using IVR solve a game better than those using a tablet application or a board game? (2) Does IVR provide a more engaging experience for children to practice problem-solving skills than on a tablet or a board game? (3) Do problem-solving skills learned with IVR technology transfer to real-life (physical game)? Children (n = 120) aged 7–9.9 years were randomly assigned to a problem-solving game in one of three conditions: board game, tablet, or IVR. The results showed that, overall, the percentage of children who completed the problem-solving game was higher in the IVR condition (77.5%), compared with those in the tablet (32.5%) or board game (30%) conditions. We also found that the interest and enjoyment scores of participants using IVR were significantly higher than participants in the other two conditions, and that the children in the IVR condition were able to learn how to solve the problem and transfer their learning to the physical game. IVR is a technology capable of engaging interest and motivating the user, as well as having the potential to assist in cognitive processing and knowledge transfer. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Problem-based learning (PBL) is an effective and highly efficient teaching approach that is extensively applied in education systems across a variety of countries. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of web-based PBL teaching pedagogies in large classes. The cluster sampling method was used to separate two college-level nursing student classes (graduating class of 2013) into two groups. The experimental group (n = 162) was taught using a web-based PBL teaching approach, while the control group (n = 166) was taught using conventional teaching methods. We subsequently assessed the satisfaction of the experimental group in relation to the web-based PBL teaching mode. This assessment was performed following comparison of teaching activity outcomes pertaining to exams and self-learning capacity between the two groups. When compared with the control group, the examination scores and self-learning capabilities were significantly higher in the experimental group (P < 0.01) compared with the control group. In addition, 92.6% of students in the experimental group expressed satisfaction with the new web-based PBL teaching approach. In a large class-size teaching environment, the web-based PBL teaching approach appears to be more optimal than traditional teaching methods. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of web-based teaching technologies in problem-based learning. © 2018},

The pre-test and post-test quasi-experimental design with a control group was used in the quantitative dimension of the study. The study group was conducted with forty-five university students. While live online classes in the experimental group were carried out via the PBL approach, live online classes in the control group were traditionally carried out via teacher-based methods without any intervention. Zoom application was used in both groups during live online classes. Group work in the experimental group was conducted using breakout rooms. The process of data collection and the experimental procedure of the study was completed in six weeks. Within the scope of the study, courses took three 40 min periods every week. The Learning Achievement Test, the Perceived Problem-solving Skills Scale, the Communication Skills Scale, and the Online Course Interaction Level Determination Scale were used for data collection tools. The results of study show that students who attended live online classes using PBL had higher levels of learning achievement, problem-solving skills and live online class interaction than students who attended live online classes using teacher-based methods. No significant difference between the communication skills of the groups was observed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

We also discuss a number of naturalistic and empirical studies that have examined the process of PBL and how its various components impact students’ learning. We conclude that the studies comparing the relative effectiveness of PBL are generally consistent in demonstrating its superior efficacy for longer-term knowledge retention and in the application of knowledge. Studies on the process of PBL, however, are still inconclusive as to which component(s) of PBL most significantly impact students’ learning, although causal studies have demonstrated that all the phases of PBL are necessary in influencing students’ learning outcomes. © 2016 King Saud bin AbdulAziz University for Health Sciences},

	abstract = {The lack of applications using a more challenging approach, involving active learning as well as student-centred and problem-centred learning, can be seen in the existing mobile applications. Thus, this paper focused on the way the Problem Based Learning (PBL) environment was integrated into the design and development process of mobile apps for learning scientific terms. The app was tested by Form 2 students to find its effect on students’ critical thinking and explore how the app helps them to think critically. The findings showed that the app had a positive effect on the students’ critical thinking. Analysis of the t-test found a significant difference (p = 0.000, t(35) = 15.072, α < 0.05) between the pre-test score (mean = 7.20, SD = 3.791) and the post-test score (M = 29.97, SD = 7.578). Data from qualitative analysis also identified four features in this app that can help students improve their critical thinking skills. The findings also showed that there were seven processes involved in the development of students’ critical thinking during the intervention. This study contributes a mobile problem-based critical thinking framework in learning science. In addition, the framework is expected to offer guidance in science subjects to promote critical thinking among students. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Research suggests that scaffolding is an important element when gaining problem-solving skills. However, very little research has investigated the role of fading and explored its implications in the context of deep learning. To address this gap, we investigated the effects of fading question prompts on argumentation as learners were given two fading schedules, (1) sustained scaffold schedule, and (2) faded scaffold schedule. We employed three different measurements of argumentation quality to triangulate the results. When using the rubric assessment method, we found no significant differences between the two conditions in argumentation quality. However, when using learning analytics to examine the conceptual linkages of students’ knowledge structure, we found that students in the sustained scaffolding condition performed significantly better than the students in the faded condition. The results indicated that (a) scaffolds should not be faded before students have acquired the necessary problem-solving processes and (b) that novices might need a fuller set of scaffolds for a longer period to support their problem-solving performance. Implications for theory and methods are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Much effort is undertaken to provide multimedia rich, attractive content to learners. While the use of multimedia technologies has a noticeable effect on students' learning, so does the selected teaching methodology. Underpinned by the Constructivist approach, problem-based learning is one of the methods that could be applied in web-based learning environments. The current study investigates the effects of problem-based learning on students' classroom community perceptions and their achievement. It focuses on the tertiary level course "Introduction to Computers" offered by the Department of Business Administration of the Distance Education Program at a higher education institution in Turkey. The results indicated that students who worked on problem-based projects felt much more 'connected' to other class members when compared to the control group. They achieved higher scores in the post-tests although their online midterm and final examination scores did not indicate any difference between the groups. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {This exploratory study examined problem-solving in an on-line problem-based learning environment. Participants included two moderators and 30 medical students in the end-of-life care Virtual Clinic. Using content analysis of transcripts, we analyzed interaction patterns in two groups of students and moderators and students' problem-solving skills as measured by the critical thinking ratio. Moderator in Group 1 posted more connected comments, feedback, and questions than the moderator in Group 2. Students in Group 1 posted more connected comments compared to students in Group 2. However, the disparate interaction patterns yielded little differences in students' critical thinking skills in both groups. We propose the use of critical thinking ratio as an effective outcome measure in assessing problem-solving skills. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

An evaluation of an alternative for computer-aided math instruction and comprehension among visually impaired students was developed, and the evaluation included seven detailed categories of factors: behavioral, emotional, cognitive, social, distracting, motivational, and modeling factors. Then, the proposed method was used to compare the alternative teaching method, including problem decomposition and vector knowledge, to the classical teaching method with a teacher. The assessment of the impact of the developed approach on improving the process of teaching mathematics in a group of blind and visually impaired students was carried out by the completion of a questionnaire prepared by a psychologist. The alternative teaching method achieved significantly better results in six of the seven proposed assessment categories.

	abstract = {In general, large passenger hubs contain a variety of transportation functional areas. The facility configuration requirements of different functional areas are not the same, and a rational collocation of spatial positions and the number of functional areas will greatly improve the level of service. By analyzing the connotations of the functional area, an optimization objective function was built, based on the average expected passenger walking time, average cross-collision delays [average delay due to collisions between passengers moving in opposing directions] of passengers, and the cost of the hub, with constraint conditions on functional acreage, shape and location, as well as a model of macroscopical layout optimization of hub facilities. A variety of optimization problem-solving methods were compared, and given the features of this model, the genetic algorithm NSGA-II was selected. Finally, this paper gives an example of a three-storey high-speed rail hub, evaluates the hub’s layout scheme, and proves that the model is effective and feasible. Therefore, the research results can be used to evaluate the layout plans of passenger transfer facilities for large hubs, and provide a theoretical foundation for perfecting hub transfer facilities. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.},

The sample was chemistry education students in IKIP Mataram that consisted of 10 males and females' students each. This study was pre-experimental research with a pretest-posttest one group design. Data collection was obtained by tests and interviews. The test of the problem-solving, in the form of the essay, was divided into three types, namely conceptual, algorithm, and conceptual-algorithm problems. Problem-solving was measured following the stages of Polya's problem-solving, namely understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and looking back. The interview was conducted to gain more insight into their problem solving skill. Data were analyzed statistically using independent sample t-test and normalized gain scores (N-gain). The results of the analysis of the initial data obtained a significant value of 0.809, which indicated there was no difference between the problem-solving skills of male and female students. Meanwhile, the final data analysis obtained a significant value of 0.034 which means there was a difference between the problem-solving skills of the students. This furthermore showed that the use of interactive multimedia in chemistry learning increased the problem-solving skills of male better than the female. Moreover, male students' problem-solving skills were higher than the females in all types of problems and at all stages of problem-solving. Due to interactive multimedia, the conceptual understanding and learning motivation of students is enhanced. © 2020 Journal for the Education of Gifted Young Scientists.},

MMVO incorporates a two-step repair strategy for handling constraints. In addition, a barrier function is employed for assigning negative values to the infeasible solutions so that their fitness cannot outperform the fitness of the feasible ones. MMVO avoids local optima by re-initializing the population every predetermined number of iterations while keeping the best solution obtained so far. For discretizing the solutions, MMVO employs a V-shaped transfer function (tanh). The research applies the proposed method to several knapsack case studies and demonstrates its application in resource allocation of Adaptive Multimedia Systems (AMS). The results show the benefits of the MMVO algorithm in solving binary test and real-world problems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The current rapid technological advancements and the dynamic workplace environments call for engineering graduates to be equipped with a combination of interdisciplinary skills. Among the core skills for the engineering profession is problem-solving. Although industry professionals and academics consider problem-solving an essential attribute of engineers in industry 4.0, research shows that several engineering graduates are not adequately equipped to apply the problem-solving approach in workplace environments. During the past years, the most common approach referred to in the literature for enhancing problem-solving skills in engineering education is Problem-Based Learning (PBL). While research reported that PBL could improve students' skills in the early stage of higher education or within their degree programmes, most engineers generally accept that graduates will ''really'' learn how to be an engineer at the workplace. This paper reports on the methodological process of designing and developing a postgraduate vocational training programme to enhance engineering graduates' problem-solving skills through PBL. Specifically, it aims to investigate the programme's impact on engineering graduates' problem-solving skills and their perceptions about the PBL experience. A mixed-methods study was applied to answer the research questions. The Problem-Solving Inventory (PSI) was used to collect quantitative data regarding engineering graduates' problem-solving skills and semi-structured interviews were used to gather qualitative data regarding the implementation of the PBL programme. The results showed that the programme was successful in developing engineering graduates' problem-solving skills. Furthermore, engineering graduates reported several additional benefits regarding their learning experience. Examples include gaining a deeper understanding of the problem-solving process, developing professional knowledge, and enhancing employability potential. They also referred to various challenges which emerged during the programme, such as the time allocation for the assimilation of new knowledge, the application of problem-solving processes, and the communication with the technical staff in the workplace settings. We hope that this work can open a platform for discussion regarding the engineering curricula and the use of problem-oriented pedagogies toward improving employability and professional skills through industry-academia collaboration. © 2022 TEMPUS Publications.},

	abstract = {In India, the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) are a vital part the Vocational Education and Training (VET) system. Previous research reveals that in addition to some other problems, it is the strongly theory-based training that impedes the transition of VET graduates into the labour market, and leads to a lack of work-readiness in young graduates. Since there is still little empirical evidence about the actual forms of teaching and learning in Indian vocational schools, this paper will examine how the learning processes in ITIs in Delhi, Coimbatore and Mumbai take place. To identify the relationship between the theory and practice of training, teacher interviews were conducted, in order to specifically examine the teacher´s beliefs and behaviours as well as classroom observations to supplement the interviews. The evidence gathered supports the thesis that ITI training is theory-driven and teacher-centred, that training is very often not practical and application-orientated, and most ITI teachers in the examined institutes have limited knowledge in the field of micro-didactics. Content knowledge and repetition of facts are more common than problem-based and learner-centred teaching. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Key objectives are to: revise the overall 6-year curriculum to be more integrated and competency-based; reinforce students’ knowledge application, problem-solving, clinical competence, self-directed learning and soft skills; develop a comprehensive and performance-based student assessment programme; and establish a comprehensive quality monitoring programme to facilitate changes and improvements. New features include early introduction to the practice of medicine, family- and community-based medicine, professionalism, interprofessional education, electives experiences, and a scholarly project. Institutional reform introduces a faculty development programme, joint planning mechanism, a “culture of critical inquiry”, and a transparent faculty reward system. Lessons learnt from the curriculum reform at UMP-FM could be helpful to medical schools from low- and middle-income countries considering transitioning from a traditional to a competency-based curriculum.

	abstract = {This study explored the impact of online lectures that were developed using principles of cognitive load theory (CLT) and cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML) on health profession students' lecture comprehension, cognitive load, cognitive engagement, and intrinsic motivation in learning. A total of 215 first-year undergraduate students in medical, dentistry, and nutrition programs participated in this pre-post quasi experimental study. The students attended a typical face-to-face lecture on Day-1 of the intervention, followed by a CLT-based online lecture 8 weeks thereafter. Their comprehension of the lecture topics was measured through pre- and post-lecture assessments, and their cognitive load, cognitive engagement, and motivation were measured immediately after each lecture session. The analysis revealed that the CLT-based online lectures promoted the students' comprehension of the lecture content (p < 0.001), self-perceived learning (p < 0.001), engagement toward the learning material, and motivation to learn (p = 0.025). It was also effective at reducing the students' intrinsic and extraneous cognitive loads (p < 0.001). Hence, designing online lectures using CLT and CTML principles could be an effective method to promote students' knowledge and comprehension, cognitive engagement, and learning motivation. However, further research is needed to investigate the applicability and impact of CLT-based online lectures in non-health profession disciplines. © Copyright © 2021 Hadie, Tan, Omar, Nik Mohd Alwi, Lim and Ku Marsilla.},

	abstract = {The potential influence of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the status of school education and further accelerated the revolution of regular teaching method. This study compared the learning effectiveness and learning strategies of vocational high school students in flipped teaching and traditional teaching modes. By adopting flipped teaching on an electronics course throughout the entire academic year, this study aimed to explore the effect of learning strategies of the students under flipped teaching. The subjects of this study were 85 sophomore students majoring in Electrical Engineering. This study randomly selected one class as the control group (n = 43), and adopted the regular teaching method while another class was selected as the experimental group (n = 42), and employed the flipped teaching method. This study used the “Learning strategy scale of students in vocational high schools” as the instrument. The students’ scores of the Testing Center for Technological and Vocational Education Test were used to evaluate their learning effectiveness. The results of this study indicate that students under the flipped teaching model made remarkable progress in the electronics course and the learning outcomes remained significant after a long period of time. Moreover, they made notable changes in their learning strategies, including “learning motivation”, “reading and exams”, “self-testing”, and “problem solving strategies”. © 2021 by the authors.

The problematic base skills together with the gamification concept for strengthening problemsolving skills were utilized with high-level vocational students. The researchers found that the style of learning gained by synthesis emphasizes students' problem-solving in various situations, stimulating and motivating them by using gamification. It involved learning and solving problems using seven steps in the teaching process including: 1) Problem, 2) Analysis, 3) Discovery, 4) Experiment, 5) Presentation, 6) Quest, and 7) Competition. The researchers also concluded that the evaluation of the suitability of the learning model by nine experts with a focus group process was found to be most appropriate.

	abstract = {Because students' ability to use statistics, which is mathematical in nature, is one of the concerns of educators, embedding within an e-learning system the pedagogical characteristics of learning is 'value added' because it facilitates the conventional method of learning mathematics. Many researchers emphasize the effectiveness of cognitive apprenticeship in learning and problem solving in the workplace. In a cognitive apprenticeship learning model, skills are learned within a community of practitioners through observation of modelling and then practice plus coaching. This study utilized an internet-based Cognitive Apprenticeship Model (i-CAM) in three phases and evaluated its effectiveness for improving statistics problem-solving performance among postgraduate students. The results showed that, when compared to the conventional mathematics learning model, the i-CAM could significantly promote students' problem-solving performance at the end of each phase. In addition, the combination of the differences in students' test scores were considered to be statistically significant after controlling for the pre-test scores. The findings conveyed in this paper confirmed the considerable value of i-CAM in the improvement of statistics learning for non-specialized postgraduate students. © 2015 Saadati et al.

Purpose The purpose of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of the debriefing assessment, problem-solving process, and team effectiveness among students who received instructor-led debriefing, self-debriefing, and combined debriefing. Methods An experimental design was conducted with 250 students (nursing, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy). Differences in the Debriefing Experience Scale (DES), Problem Solving Inventory (PSI), and Communication and Teamwork Skills (CATS) assessment between the groups were measured. Results In nursing students, the combined debriefing group had the highest scores for the CATS assessment (P <.001) and for the coordination (P <.001), cooperation (P =.012), and communication (P =.002) categories. No significant differences were observed between debriefing groups for DES or PSI. Conclusions Combined debriefing improves communication and team skills in students. Educators might promote combined debriefing after simulation sessions as it seems to improve team effectiveness.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The transformation of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) prioritizes by the national education convention to meet the needs of the industry through improving student skills and the quality of related systems. One of the transformations is practicing blended learning, such as a flipped classroom, to produce better quality student learning outcomes. However, based on previous studies, there are difficulties in maintaining student engagement during learning activities, even though blended learning offers some advantages. Therefore, this study suggests the development of a mobile application using gamification as a solution to enhance student participation. This paper proposes the design and development research (DDR) approach with the adaptation of the ADDIE model to build a learning content prototype. It involves five phases: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The study participants consisted of two groups of students in the 1st semester of the Interactive Multimedia course from two different TVET institutions who were cleft into a control group and an experimental group. The experimental group is gamified, whereas the control group is not. The study evaluation uses two instruments: a test to compare students' understanding of both groups and an activity log to track the experimental group's use of the prototype. According to the findings, gamification during learning activities can increase student engagement by boosting performance through a more significant pre-and post-test mean score difference and creating a positive learning experience. Additionally, mobile applications with the gamification concept can be employed extensively in various TVET courses to encourage student learning performance © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Malaysia is focused on the development and use of technologies among consumers. Thus, technological innovations are used in the adaptation of online learning to educate students, as well as to enhance the teaching and learning process in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions. There is a need to expose students to the online learning revolution, which conceptualises using computerised systems to facilitate the learning process. However, the COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted the academic year across the country. Due to the unusual circumstances related to the pandemic, the Malaysian government has urged all academic institutions to conduct online teaching and learning. Thus, an e-Learning system, known as SpmiILP, has been designed and developed accordingly for an interactive multimedia course to encourage online interaction among students and lecturers, as well as to enhance human learning and cognitive development. In fact, these essential elements such as learning style of the students and user experience are focused on to engage them in learning effectively as well. An e-Learning System for Interactive Multimedia Course was used to develop the e-Learning system (SpmiILP). The usability test showed that the developed e-Learning system has a positive influence that provided potential contributions to (TVET) students in their learning processes. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

This is particularly relevant on the era of Industry 4.0, which integrates new technologies with industrial automation. The objective of this study is to qualitatively analyze the teaching and learning of selected Physics and Mathematics subjects through experiential learning, employing an Automated Guided Vehicle as a Learning Object for practical activities. The research led to the development of a Didactic Sequence, which was implemented with students enrolled in the Integrated Technical High School Course. The Experiential Learning proposed, aimed to involve students as the primary actors in the learning process, engaging them actively in constructing their own knowledge. It was observed that the use of AGV emerges as a relevant educational tool, capable of enhancing the teaching and learning processes, and providing students with a more tangible and meaningful experience, combining work, science, and culture through activities that embrace a polytechnic education.

However, literature suggests ambiguity regarding their effectiveness in producing desired outcomes. Extant systematic reviews and meta-analyses of these programs are dated, focus on post-release programs, and rely on monolithic effect sizes to determine if these programs ‘work.’ To assess this issue, we conduct a meta-analysis of 31 program evaluations published between 1986 and 2017, focusing on study and program characteristics that moderate conclusions of success. We argue that several issues require attention before researchers can conclude whether and for whom custodial work and vocational programs are successful, including: incomparable outcomes; treatment heterogeneity and treatment effect heterogeneity; program stacking; and conflicting definitions of programs. Implications from this study aid in establishing a cohesive literature to make stronger conclusions about the characteristics of programs and program evaluations that produce effective custodial work and vocation programs. © 2022 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.},

	abstract = {Prior research shows employment is an important component of desistance, but there is mixed evidence regarding the effectiveness of prison-based education programs. Therefore, this study examines whether participation in vocational education programs while incarcerated improves recidivism and post-release employment outcomes. In addition, the study controls for the timing of release to examine whether recidivism and employment outcomes varied during the COVID-19 pandemic. Observable selection bias was reduced by using propensity score matching to create similar treatment and comparison groups. After matching, there were no differences in any outcome between those who obtained vocational certificates and the comparison group. The results demonstrate the importance of accounting for selection bias in evaluations of education and employment programs. It is recommended that career-focused educational programs incorporate the risk-needs-responsivity model and the continuum of care principle, build relationships with community employers, and assist with practical barriers to employment. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {We investigate a problem in vocational school planning for nurses in countries with a dual vocational system, which closely combines theoretical and practical education and is highly regulated by federal legislation. The apprentices rotate through vocational school-blocks followed by assignments to hospital units, where they receive practical education. This program is regulated in high detail. Hospital units offer some slots for apprentices but expect just enough apprentices to be trained and educated. We create two mixed-integer programming models to optimally solve the underlying planning problems of (1) scheduling classes to theoretical and practical education blocks and (2) assigning apprentices to hospital units. The first model determines the number and length of school- and work-blocks on a class level, where its result is input to the second model, which finds individual unit-assignments for every apprentice fulfilling detailed curriculum requirements. Furthermore, it tries to exploit the units' educational capacities as well as possible. To solve the second model, we develop a heuristic decomposition procedure that enables good feasible solutions in short time. Our computational study is based on real-world data of our cooperation partner and provides valuable insights for management. The dataset consists of manually created schedules over the full 3-year program horizon and information on hospital units and their respective capacities. We test different parameter settings for our heuristic procedure and how they influence solution quality and runtime. Finally, we test, if students can be enabled to request individual vacations and evaluate benefits and drawbacks of different degrees of flexibility. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

However, the current higher vocational students have a poor learning foundation and lack the motivation to learn, so it is necessary to reform the training of talents and the traditional classroom teaching mode of higher vocational colleges. Based on the specific teaching practice of the computer “Bilingual C Programming” course on the intelligent cloud platform, this paper explores the unique characteristics of higher vocational teaching under the background of mobile Internet and big data technology, according to different learning conditions and different teaching environments. Combining multiple teaching modes organically, achieving complementary advantages through the use of online and offline mixed teaching, using flipped classroom and PAD (Presentation Assimilation Discussion) class teaching modes, and adopting process evaluation methods to achieve teaching goals of “teaching with improvement, learning with achievement, teaching and learning mutually beneficial”. The results of empirical research show that the students who adopt the flipped classroom and the PAD class teaching mode show good learning results and stronger learning motivation. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to determine students’ learning performance who underwent simulation software class on the Programming and Arduino Microcontroller Subject. A quasi-experimental study, with pretest and posttest design was implemented. The subject involved 74 vocational high school students (37 in the control group and 37 in the experimental group) have undergone eight weeks of treatment, using conventional and Proteus simulation software. Students’ performance was measured using achievement test; involved cognitive, psychomotor, and affective aspect, which was based on the Bloom’s Taxonomy. The result indicated that students in the experimental group have outperformed their counterpart in the control group in cognitive aspect (81.4 vs 76.24), affective aspect (81.83 vs 76.34) and psychomotor aspect (79.04 vs 70.37). Further analysis using independent t-test, result indicated that the experimental group’s performance has significantly difference from the control group’s performance at all aspects [t(72) = 3.068, p = .004]. In conclusion, simulation software using Proteus has a significant contribution to increase students’ performance in learning. The implication is that, teaching difficult subject involves programming of microcontroller should use simulation software, so that students become more enthusiast, have many choices in experimenting and capable of nurturing creativity. Future study suggested to focus on the effect of simulation software on nurturing specific creativity skills. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.},

	abstract = {Peer assessments (PA) have been widely explored by researchers over the past few decades. However, their impact on various learning environments remains unclear. Based on a meta-analysis, this study aimed to analyze PA-based research performed across multiple learning environments. Unlike existing meta-analyses, however, this study integrated co-citation network analysis with the meta-analysis to examine the bibliometric relationships between the analyzed studies. This method provides citation-based evidence to secure the association of research data for conducting the meta-analysis. In addition, the visualized research network offers a fresh micro-to-macro understanding of the PA literature. A total of 20 PA-related core articles consisting of their follow-up 340 citing studies were collected based on systematic keyword searches. All analyzed articles were published between 1998 and 2020, and were sourced from two renowned databases, the Web of Science and Scopus, in order to maintain the quality of the data used for this present research. The main findings are twofold. First, the meta-analysis reported that the standard error at the 95% confidence interval for the average difference between the experimental and control groups is [0.288, 0.424], indicating that each effect value in the meta-analysis is heterogeneous. We also found that technology combined with PA teaching methods has certain learning effects in the contexts of web-based problem-solving activities. In addition, following Fu and Hwang's (2018) constructivist theoretical framework, we propose some criteria for conducting peer assessment research. Second, the co-citation network analysis presented a visualized networking structure of 20 PA articles, of which 11 were bibliographically connected. This result echoed the previous research by reviewing the relationships between the studies in the meta-analysis. Moreover, the co-citation network of PA research reveals some heavy co-citation links from the 11 core articles. The results further identified the main research foci include combining PA with technology-enhanced learning environments (e.g., game- and web-based learning) and PA activities for collaborative learning in the field. In conclusion, this study presents an innovative approach to examining the effects of empirical PA studies and, accordingly, offers discussions and directions for future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, researchers attempted to compare the effectiveness of web-based collaborative problem-solving systems (wCPSS) and classroom-based collaborative hands-on learning activities (cCHLA) in the development of collaborative problem-solving skills in junior high school students who were learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related subjects. A quasi-experimental, nonequivalent pretest–posttest control group design was employed, and 241 junior high school students were invited to participate in the study. According to the results, a wCPSS-supported environment with teacher guidance was found to be more effective than either a wCPSS-supported environment without teacher guidance or a cCHLA-facilitated environment in developing students’ collaborative problem-solving skills in STEM fields. The study suggested that a web-based collaborative problem-solving system with teacher guidance can be used in developing junior high students’ collaborative problem-solving skills in STEM education. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

This paper investigates the potential of using web-based tools to teach students problem-solving techniques without the need to make use of class time. An idea generation experiment involving 90 students was designed. Students were surveyed about their study habits and reported they use electronic-based materials more than paper-based materials while studying, suggesting students may engage with web-based tools. Students then generated solutions to a problem task using either a paper-based template or an equivalent web interface. Students who used the web-based approach performed as well as students who used the paper-based approach, suggesting the technique can be successfully adopted and taught online. Web-based tools may therefore be adopted as supplementary material in a range of engineering courses as a way to increase students’ options for enhancing problem-solving skills. © 2017 SEFI.},

	abstract = {On-demand video has become a seamless part of the fabric of information consumption. Initially inspired by the popularity of video guides for practical skills such as cooking and DIY, instructional videos were developed for equipment used in the first-year chemical engineering undergraduate teaching laboratory at Imperial College London. During 2016/2017, the effect of the videos on the students' learning was measured using video viewership metrics, a survey, focus groups with students and Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and rounded off through interviews with the module teaching team. Student reactions were overall positive, with >90% of students stating they found the videos useful. The outcome of our study indicated that because of access to the videos before, during, and after lab sessions, students were more confident in their own ability, spent more time engaging with theory, applied practical lab skills in a more targeted way, and produced better outputs. Rather than being just a video version of the experiment handout, the video influenced the behavior of both learners and teachers, freeing up time to engage in deeper exploration of topics. The results of the study suggest that the use of video-led instruction in undergraduate laboratory teaching improves student experience, saves GTA time, and decidedly shifts the teaching focus from demonstration to exploration. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

	abstract = {Polymer chemistry is essential within chemical education because of its applications in academic and industrial research, materials science, and across engineering disciplines. Teaching polymer chemistry principles early on in the undergraduate curriculum allows students to find connections between chemistry and real-world applications and can promote interest in science and scientific research. Performing laboratory experiments on polymers is of equal importance when integrating polymer concepts into undergraduate-level lectures. There are several widely utilized lab demonstrations on polymer synthesis, characterization, and applications, yet more, easy-to-handle experiments are needed that connect polymers to organic reactions, spectroscopy, and sustainability, especially in a virtual setting. This virtual experiment was designed to incorporate the synthesis of high sulfur-content polymers into the general chemistry laboratory during the pandemic. Teaching assistants (TAs) performed the experiments and collected the necessary data and observations for students. Video recordings of the polymerization reactions, reaction times, and collages of digital images depicting reaction progress (viscosity and color changes) are provided to students. During a single 2-3-h virtual lab meeting, students watch the lab videos, read the student handout and a research paper, and discuss the results and observations with their peers and lab TAs. The lab experiment demonstrates the interdependence of general chemistry learning objectives including chemical bonding, radicals, reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, stoichiometric calculations, and spectroscopy. In addition, this virtual experiment introduces undergraduate students to polymer chemistry, encourages them to look beyond the textbooks and lecture resources by using literature articles, and connects general chemistry concepts with upper-level chemistry classes. Postlab survey results show that students find the video recordings and group discussions on the polymerization reactions very helpful in understanding a new concept within a virtual distant-learning environment.  © 2021 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: This work aims to evaluate the role of digital health in supporting the mental and psychological well-being of patients with cancer and identify the associated challenges of use and implementation. Methods: Eligibility criteria: We included peer-reviewed studies (quantitative/qualitative) published between January 2011 and July 2022, that are written in English using technology to support cancer patients' mental health. We excluded opinion papers, editorials, and commentaries. Information sources: The systematic review was conducted across ProQuest CENTRAL, Scopus, PubMed, PsycInfo, Web Of Science, and IEEE Xplore. The study selection followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews, meta-Analysis Reviews, and meta-Analysis guidelines (PRISMA). Risk of bias: All screening steps followed a consensus between the authors to minimize bias or discrepancy. Synthesis of the results: Data were extracted following the Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being (SMPW). The technology challenges are summarized following the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model (SEIPS), focusing on design, impact on processes, and outcomes. Results: We included 25 studies satisfying our inclusion criteria. The studies had little interest in minorities and sociodemographic factors' assessment within their results. The review showed that mental health and psychological well-being tools cover many applications. In addition to allowing personal growth, digital health can help cancer patients gain more autonomy and self-acceptance. Moreover, these health technologies can aid in mastering the environment, shaping social relationships, and pursuing life goals. Many challenges were identified related to the environment, organization, users, and tasks. Discussion: Digital health applications for cancer care cover a broad spectrum of mental health interventions. Challenges warrant analyzing the needs and usability. Lessons learned during COVID-19 may help refine technology interventions for mental health in cancer care. More interest in minorities is needed when designing technologies for patients to ensure more access to equitable care. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Results: Overall, PBL had a greater positive effect than traditional learning on critical thinking (SMD: 0.44; 95 % CI: 0.14–0.73), analysis (SMD: 0.72; 95 % CI: 0.84–1.25), and evaluation (SMD: 0.33; 95 % CI: 0.05–0.61). However, the impact of PBL on problem-solving and self-confidence need further investigation. Conclusions: PBL appears to improve nursing students' critical thinking skills, especially their ability to analyze and evaluate. The findings of this study may be used as evidence of PBL being a more effective method than traditional/conventional learning techniques for increasing students' critical thinking. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT was used to answer questions from final exams administered in two general chemistry courses, including questions with closed-response format and with open-response format. For closed-response questions, ChatGPT was very capable at identifying the concept even when the question included a great deal of chemical symbolism. However, ChatGPT’s success at solving problems was only 44%, a value well below the class average of 69%. On open-response questions, ChatGPT’s responses displayed strong language processing ability with higher performance on questions that could be solved with more generalizable information compared to questions that required specific skills, especially when those topics or skills were primarily found in lecture. Incorrect responses and flawed explanations were often logically sound and would be persuasive to a novice. The chatbot is currently ill-equipped to provide reliable answers or explanations to students for many representative exam questions, but a potential use is to create assignments in which students analyze and improve ChatGPT’s responses. © 2023 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

	abstract = {Student performance on open-response calculations involving acid and base solutions before and after instruction in general chemistry and analytical chemistry courses was compared with the output from the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. Applying a theoretical model of expertise for problem solving that includes problem conceptualization, problem strategy, and solution, it is found that students errors following instruction primarily involved problem conceptualization and the misapplication of heuristics like the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation When the same problems were used as input to ChatGPT the responses were comparable to worked examples found in general chemistry textbooks in terms of length and detail and usually displayed strong problem conceptualization. Response accuracy of the chatbot varied greatly for different topics, being best for calculations of pH for a strong acid or strong base and much lower for more complex problems involving titrations or aqueous salts. Chatbot and student errors differed in that the chatbot did not misapply heuristics but did make mathematical errors uncommon for students. The variability in the correctness of ChatGPT’s responses and the nature of its errors vis-à-vis students will influence its potential use as an instructional resource for calculations involving acids and bases. © 2023 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: The number of randomized, controlled studies of cognitive remediation (CR) for mood disorders (major depressive disorder [MDD] and bipolar illness [BD]), has grown substantially over the past 10 years. The role of study quality, participant characteristics, and intervention features in CR treatment effects remains largely unknown. Methods: Electronic databases were searched up to February 2022 using variants of the key words: “cognitive remediation”, “clinical trials”, “major depressive disorder” and “bipolar disorder”. This search produced 22 unique randomized, controlled trials that met all inclusion criteria for the study. Data were extracted by 3 authors with strong reliability (>90 %). Primary cognitive, and secondary symptom and functional outcomes were assessed with random effects models. Results: The meta-analysis (993 participants) revealed that CR produced significant small-to-moderate size effects in attention, verbal learning and memory, working memory and executive function (Hedge's g = 0.29–0.45). CR produced a small-moderate effect on one secondary outcome: depressive symptoms (g = 0.33). CR programs that used an individualized approach produced larger effects on executive function. Samples with lower baseline IQ were more likely to benefit from CR on measures of working memory. Sample age, education, gender, or baseline depressive symptomatology did not serve as barriers to treatment gains, and observed effects were not epiphenomena of poorer design quality. Limitations: The number of RCTs remains low. Conclusions: CR produces small to moderate improvements in cognition and depressive symptoms in mood disorders. Future research should study how CR might be optimized to help generalize CR-related cognitive and symptom improvements to function. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

There are many examples of successful PA management around the globe, although a systematic and comprehensive approach to developing and sharing these solutions has been lacking. We present “solutioning” as a structured process of peer-learning, which can inform management strategies in and around protected areas. We explain how the PANORAMA—Solutions for a Healthy Planet initiative has put solutioning into practice through an interactive community and web portal to learn about protected area solutions around the globe. Unlike other web platforms and initiatives reviewed, PANORAMA facilitates adaptation of solution elements (i.e., building blocks) for novel implementation. Supported by theories of resilience and peer-learning, PANORAMA appears to have potential to promote efficiency and equitable benefits for PAs and associated stakeholders focused on nature conservation and sustainable development, although further research is needed to assess whether this learning leads to better solutions or more effective PA management. © 2018, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Memory strategy training for older adults helps maintain and improve cognitive health but is traditionally offered face-to-face, which is resource intensive, limits accessibility, and is challenging during a pandemic. Web-based interventions, such as the Online Personalised Training in Memory Strategies for Everyday (OPTIMiSE) program, may overcome such barriers. Objective: We report on OPTIMiSE’s feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy. Methods: Australians aged ≥60 years reporting subjective cognitive decline participated in this single-arm pre-post web-based intervention. OPTIMiSE is a 6-module web-based program offered over 8-weeks with a 3-month booster. It has a problem-solving approach to memory issues, focusing on psychoeducation about memory and aging, knowledge and practice of compensatory memory strategies, and personalized content related to individual priorities. We examined the feasibility (recruitment, attrition, and data collection), acceptability (recommendation to others, suggestions for improvement, and withdrawal reasons), and efficacy (change in goal satisfaction, strategy knowledge and use, self-reported memory, memory satisfaction and knowledge, and mood; thematic content analysis of the most significant change; and the application of knowledge and strategies in daily life) of OPTIMiSE. Results: OPTIMiSE was feasible, demonstrated by strong interest (633 individuals screened), a satisfactory level of attrition (158/312, 50.6%), and minimal missing data from those completing the intervention. It was acceptable, with 97.4% (150/154) of participants agreeing they would recommend OPTIMiSE, the main suggestion for improvement being more time to complete modules, and withdrawal reasons similar to those in in-person interventions. OPTIMiSE was also efficacious, with linear mixed-effects analyses revealing improvements, of moderate to large effect sizes, across all primary outcomes (all P<.001): memory goal satisfaction (Cohen d after course=1.24; Cohen d at 3-month booster=1.64), strategy knowledge (Cohen d after course=0.67; Cohen d at 3-month booster=0.72) and use (Cohen d after course=0.79; Cohen d at 3-month booster=0.90), self-reported memory (Cohen d after course=0.80; Cohen d at 3-month booster=0.83), memory satisfaction (Cohen d after course=1.25; Cohen d at 3-month booster=1.29) and knowledge (Cohen d after course=0.96; Cohen d at 3-month booster=0.26), and mood (Cohen d after course=−0.35; nonsignificant Cohen d at booster). Furthermore, the most significant changes reported by participants (strategy use, improvements in daily life, reduced concern about memory, confidence and self-efficacy, and sharing and shame busting with others) reflected the course objectives and were consistent with themes arising from previous in-person interventions. At the 3-month booster, many participants reported continued implementation of knowledge and strategies in their daily lives. Conclusions: This feasible, acceptable, and efficacious web-based program has the potential to enable access to evidence-based memory interventions for older adults worldwide. Notably, the changes in knowledge, beliefs, and strategy use continued beyond the initial program. This is particularly important for supporting the growing number of older adults living with cognitive concerns. ©Kerryn Pike, Carl I Moller, Christina Bryant, Maree Farrow, Duy P Dao, Kathryn A Ellis.},

	abstract = {Dyscalculia is the lack of ability to acquire arithmetical or numerical skills in mathematics. Students with such learning disability fail to understand the basic concepts of mathematical problem such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This leads to lack of understanding of the problem domain in finding the correct solution to solve mathematical problems. Since the past years, the traditional teaching and learning activities have evolved to ICT-facilitated learning environment utilizing tablets and computers. Most software provided for teachers at schools are specifically for students with other forms of learning disabilities, hence lacking of specific courseware or software to cater the learning needs for dyscalculia students. Thus, this study was conducted in realization to assist dyscalculia students in their learning; i.e. development of an adaptive web-based courseware. The courseware could be used both in class and at home. The courseware conceptual model was adopted and built upon theories on cognitive learning and multisensory method of learning. User review and feedback were gathered to gauge the first-hand user experience with the courseware. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

New technology should be one of our great allies in addressing these problems. This article proposes an expert system with a web-based problem-solving simulator for a multidevice environment in order to allow students to access an unlimited number of problems with their corresponding solutions, immediately, anytime and anywhere. The types of problems that can be used are those based on quantitative methods with a fixed methodology to be followed. A successful case study was carried out for the subject Operations Management at the Distance University of Madrid (UDIMA), with three different problem simulators having been developed. The results were very satisfactory compared with previous academic years in terms of motivation. A decrease in students that did not sit the final examination was observed, as was an increase in the number of visits to the Moodle classroom. Students also responded positively in their assessments of the initiative. © 2019 Wiley Publishing Ltd},

This study reports the experience in the first semester of 2020 for a Chemical Engineering Capstone Design Course at the University of Campinas in Brazil. In this course, senior year students develop a group project, in which they simulate a chemical plant and evaluate its technoeconomic feasibility. In 2020, the groups were proposed to design a process to replace diesel fuel from the bus fleet in Campinas city with renewable fuel DME. Because of the pandemic, several adaptations were needed: the theoretical classes became asynchronous, group meetings were online, a commercial simulator was replaced by an open access one, and the schedule was extended by 2 weeks. Despite that, the students had a great performance, comparable to face-to-face. To assess student satisfaction, a questionnaire was used. The course met the expectations of most of the students who also recommended keeping it in the remote format or merging it with face-to-face teaching. Therefore, these changes made it possible to apply new teaching dynamics and tools that could be used in the future to improve the course quality. © 2021 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Approximately 80% of breast cancers are oestrogen receptor positive (ER+). Patients treated surgically are usually recommended adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) for 5–10 years. AET significantly reduces recurrence, but up to 50% of women do not take it as prescribed. Objective: To co-design and develop an intervention to support AET adherence and improve health-related quality-of-life (QoL) in women with breast cancer. Methods: Design and development of the HT&Me intervention took a person-based approach and was guided by the Medical Research Council framework for complex interventions, based on evidence and underpinned by theory. Literature reviews, behavioural analysis, and extensive key stakeholder involvement informed ‘guiding principles’ and the intervention logic model. Using co-design principles, a prototype intervention was developed and refined. Results: The blended tailored HT&Me intervention supports women to self-manage their AET. It comprises initial and follow-up consultations with a trained nurse, supported with an animation video, a web-app and ongoing motivational ‘nudge’ messages. It addresses perceptual (e.g. doubts about necessity, treatment concerns) and practical (e.g. forgetting) barriers to adherence and provides information, support and behaviour change techniques to improve QoL. Iterative patient feedback maximised feasibility, acceptability, and likelihood of maintaining adherence; health professional feedback maximised likelihood of scalability. Conclusions: HT&Me has been systematically and rigorously developed to promote AET adherence and improve QoL, and is complemented with a logic model documenting hypothesized mechanisms of action. An ongoing feasibility trial will inform a future randomised control trial of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. © 2023},

	abstract = {The Web of Data, which is one of the dimensions of the Semantic Web (SW), represents a tremendous source of information, which motivates the increasing attention to the formalization and application of machine learning methods for solving tasks such as concept learning, link prediction, inductive instance retrieval in this context. However, the Web of Data is also characterized by various forms of uncertainty, owing to its inherent incompleteness (missing information, uneven data distributions) and noise, which may affect open and distributed architectures. In this paper, we focus on the inductive instance retrieval task regarded as a classification problem. The proposed solution is a framework for learning Terminological Decision Trees from examples described in an ontological knowledge base, to be used for performing instance classifications. For the purpose, suitable pruning strategies and a new prediction procedure are proposed. Furthermore, in order to tackle the class-imbalance distribution problem, the framework is extended to ensembles of Terminological Decision Trees called Terminological Random Forests. The proposed framework has been evaluated, in comparative experiments, with the main state of the art solutions grounded on a similar approach, showing that: (1) the employment of the formalized pruning strategies can improve the model predictiveness; (2) Terminological Random Forests outperform the usage of a single Terminological Decision Tree, particularly when the knowledge base is endowed with a large number of concepts and roles; (3) the framework can be exploited for solving related problems, such as predicting the values of given properties with finite ranges. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In chemistry, building arguments and applying concept knowledge is closely linked to evaluating claims, supporting claims with evidence, and justifying the linkage of evidence to claim with reasoning. However, previous studies revealed that, when building arguments, students experience challenges either in differentiating between argument components, in applying concept knowledge, or in building multivariate arguments. Scaffolding may remediate these challenges by supporting students as they focus on the expected argument structure and/or activate the required concept knowledge. As students enter the classroom with different prior knowledge, supports need to be adapted to students' needs. Thus, we designed a two-part argumentation training. The first part is a diagnostic training, in which students receive training for building arguments while their performance is analyzed. The second part consists of four trainings, adapted to the area in which each student experienced the greatest challenges, e.g., (1) in differentiating between argument components, (2) in applying concept knowledge, (3) in both areas, or (4) in building multivariate arguments. The tasks in the trainings center on building arguments on alternative reaction pathways in organic chemistry and combine a multitude of chemical concepts, such as nucleophilicity, basicity, enthalpy, or entropy. There were 64 students enrolled in an Organic Chemistry II course who participated in the training. Evaluation of the two-part training revealed (a) the effectiveness of the training and (b) how students evaluated the training themselves. © 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop an educational program to strengthen the nursing management competency of experienced nurses who are prospective nurse managers and then determine the effectiveness of the program. This quasi-experimental study was conducted from January to April 2021. A total of 22 nurses were assigned to the experiment group (mean age: 26.55 ± 1.30 years; 2 males, 20 females), and 20 were assigned to the control group (mean age: 27.55 ± 2.04 years; 20 females). The program, known as the “High-Up” program, comprised problem-based learning (PBL) and video lectures. In the experiment group, nurses discussed PBL cases through video conferences and applied problem-solving methods. The collected data were analyzed using the Friedman test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test (administered through SPSS). At four weeks after the intervention, the experiment group showed higher critical thinking tendency scores than the control group (pre-intervention score: 3.48 ± 0.36; post-intervention score: 3.71 ± 0.49; Z = −1.99, p = 0.046). The findings indicate that the “High-Up” program can enhance the nurse management competency of experienced nurses who need to prepare for nurse manager roles, and that it can also positively influence the performance of nursing organizations. However, it can be difficult to comprehensively enhance nursing management competency in a short period of time, meaning continuous education is required. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Feedback-driven online homework systems provide students with a comprehensive set of practice questions that can accompany and enhance other instructional resources. However, the available e-homework systems do not contain content that aligns well with our course objectives, provide too few questions in key areas, and use assessment format(s) that do not match the ones used on our exams. Motivated to create our own questions, we used this gap as an opportunity to engage students in constructing and reviewing course-aligned content within a commercial e-homework platform. The students successfully generated approximately 1,000 largely open-ended organic chemistry questions, some with mechanistic and structural drawing capabilities, by modifying old exam questions. The students' questions spanned a variety of cognitive levels that skewed, as intended, toward skill-building. According to our assessment scheme, 75% of the questions were evaluated to be of the highest quality. As a consequence, we advocate that collaborating with undergraduate students in a "teaching team" can be a broadly useful way for instructors to generate high-quality instructional materials aligned with their course content. © 2016 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

	abstract = {Peer assessments (PA) have been widely explored by researchers over the past few decades. However, their impact on various learning environments remains unclear. Based on a meta-analysis, this study aimed to analyze PA-based research performed across multiple learning environments. Unlike existing meta-analyses, however, this study integrated co-citation network analysis with the meta-analysis to examine the bibliometric relationships between the analyzed studies. This method provides citation-based evidence to secure the association of research data for conducting the meta-analysis. In addition, the visualized research network offers a fresh micro-to-macro understanding of the PA literature. A total of 20 PA-related core articles consisting of their follow-up 340 citing studies were collected based on systematic keyword searches. All analyzed articles were published between 1998 and 2020, and were sourced from two renowned databases, the Web of Science and Scopus, in order to maintain the quality of the data used for this present research. The main findings are twofold. First, the meta-analysis reported that the standard error at the 95% confidence interval for the average difference between the experimental and control groups is [0.288, 0.424], indicating that each effect value in the meta-analysis is heterogeneous. We also found that technology combined with PA teaching methods has certain learning effects in the contexts of web-based problem-solving activities. In addition, following Fu and Hwang's (2018) constructivist theoretical framework, we propose some criteria for conducting peer assessment research. Second, the co-citation network analysis presented a visualized networking structure of 20 PA articles, of which 11 were bibliographically connected. This result echoed the previous research by reviewing the relationships between the studies in the meta-analysis. Moreover, the co-citation network of PA research reveals some heavy co-citation links from the 11 core articles. The results further identified the main research foci include combining PA with technology-enhanced learning environments (e.g., game- and web-based learning) and PA activities for collaborative learning in the field. In conclusion, this study presents an innovative approach to examining the effects of empirical PA studies and, accordingly, offers discussions and directions for future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the sciences, the laboratory is one of the most impactful spaces for student learning, engagement, and experience. Prior knowledge gleaned during lecture and laboratory discussion (i.e., a course section designed to further emphasize conceptual content underlying experiments and inform students about laboratory procedures or safety precautions) acts to supplement laboratory performance. With the recent increase in offering traditionally face-to-face courses in remote formats, many educators in the field of organic chemistry have opted to offer online laboratory discussion (LD) sections alongside more traditional face-to-face laboratory discussions. However, research on enrollment in laboratory discussions by modality, as well as their impact on subsequent course performance, is lacking. Conducting a logistic regression analysis, we found that females, students who identified as Black or African American, those with greater average ACT-SAT equivalency scores, and those students who completed organic chemistry LD online in the prior term all had greater odds of enrolling in an online organic chemistry LD course in subsequent academic terms. Additional hierarchical regression analyses indicated that many student- and academic-level factors were predictive of laboratory performance. Notably, when controlling student-level and academic-level characteristics, laboratory performance was higher for students who completed LD online compared to students who enrolled in face-to-face LDs. This study has important implications for students as they uptake courses in online settings and faculty as they decide what portions of their courses to offer remotely. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

We illustrate how theories of agency can provide new insights into such challenges by examining the application of these theories to one particular wicked problem in HPE: interprofessional education (IPE). Methods: After searching the HPE literature and finding that theories of agency had received little attention, we borrowed techniques from narrative literature reviews to search databases indexing a broad scope of disciplines (i.e. ERIC, Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE and PubMed) for publications (1994–2014) that: (i) examined agency, or (ii) incorporated an agency-informed analytical perspective. The lead author identified the theories of agency used in these articles, and reviewed the texts on agency cited therein and the original sources of each theory. We identified 10 theories of agency that we considered to be applicable to HPE's wicked problems. To select a subset of theories for presentation in this paper, we discussed each theory in relation to some of HPE's wicked problems. Through debate and reflection, we unanimously agreed on the applicability of a subset of theories for illuminating HPE's wicked problems. This subset is described in this paper. Results: We present four theories of agency: Butler's post-structural formulation; Giddens’ sociological formulation; cultural historical activity theory's formulation, and Bandura's social cognitive psychology formulation. We introduce each theory and apply each to the challenges of engaging in IPE. Conclusions: Theories of agency can inform HPE scholarship in novel and generative ways. Each theory offers new insights into the roots of wicked problems and means for contending with them. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical Education},

The present work puts a specific focus on developing student skills to ensure that the students (i) are aware of the resources involved in obtaining the spectral data and (ii) obtain the skills necessary to handle spectra which have not been processed by experts, to better reflect the use of spectroscopic techniques in their later work life. This is achieved through the web-based spectroscopy activity iSpec, in which the basic idea is that every action costs resources. The cost of a resource is given in the form of resource points (RPs), such that different experimental data can be "purchased" for a number of RPs. © 2017 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

The independent variables in this study include the type of scaffolding (task-supported, self-monitoring) and the student's epistemological belief level (more advanced, less advanced). The dependent variables include three components of problem-solving skill (problem representation, solution development, monitoring and evaluation). The two-way multivariate analysis of variance results reveal that students in the self-monitoring scaffolding group earned higher scores on problem representation and solution development than those in the task-supported scaffolding group. Students with more advanced epistemological beliefs also earned higher scores on solution development and monitoring and evaluation than did those with less advanced epistemological beliefs. In addition, a significant interaction was found between scaffolding type and epistemological belief level. These findings suggest that students can benefit from self-monitoring scaffolding in web-based problem solving and that different types of scaffolding should be provided according to the student's epistemological belief level. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Background: Transferring what has been learned in the classroom to clinical application is the main goal of nursing education. Our previous intervention study, in which a web-based interactive situational teaching strategy in a nursing ethic course was conducted as an experimental group, and the students in the class who were taught using a traditional teaching strategy was treated as the comparative group. The results, which were evaluated immediately after the class, showed that the web-based interactive situational teaching enhanced the students' competency in ethical reasoning and problem solving compared to traditional teaching. Purpose: This study followed the previous study and aimed to compare the effects of the learning transfer between the two groups in clinical performance as reflected in their internship scores, clinical practice, and self-efficacy assessment. It also explored the factors influencing this transfer. Method: A predictive correlation-based research design was adopted to compare the students' internship scores, clinical judgment abilities, and self-efficacy in clinical internships between two groups. The students' self-efficacy was measured using a self-administered structured questionnaire, while their internship scores and clinical judgment abilities were evaluated by their clinical instructors. The data obtained were statistically analyzed using SPSS 23 software. Results: The nursing students who participated in the web-based interactive situational teaching course did not significantly outperform those who received traditional teaching in their clinical judgment and internship scores. The main variable that significantly affected the clinical self-efficacy of nursing students was the degree of support from the internship instructors. Conclusion: Nursing students' clinical performance is affected by multiple factors and is not solely determined by the curriculum or teaching strategies. The degree of instructor support during the internship process significantly affected the students' self-efficacy in clinical performance. © 2021},

	abstract = {COVID-19 posed new challenges to undergraduate medical biochemistry instructors, providing an opportunity of exploring novel approaches online through methods such as case-based learning curriculum. In this study, an entire curriculum was created for medical biochemistry teaching online using case-based learning including the standards, time for lessons, cases, and methods behind teaching in an online format. To evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum, student case study question results, grades on exams, and perception were analyzed. The results show that 40 students enrolled in the case-based learning curriculum had an average final exam score of 10.33% (95% CI [3.539, 17.112], p = 0.004) higher compared to the traditional curriculum students (d = 0.861, 95% CI [0.269, 1.444]). No significant difference was found between exam scores on any other exam in the course. Due to the final exam being a cumulative exam, the results suggest that the case-based learning curriculum improved student retention of information long-term but had no discernible effect on individual exams. This study provides all the tools necessary for instructors to immediately use a medical biochemistry case-based learning curriculum supported by research without the necessary time investment of creating their own cases from scratch.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of this study is to measure changes in students’ perception on their problem solving ability over time by using Rasch Measurement Model. Pre-experimental with one group pretest-posttest design was conducted to investigate how web-based learning system of design education, known as PROUD, affected students’ perceptions of their problem solving ability. Thirty second-year students pursuing their bachelor degree in technical and vocational education participated in the study. Respondents utilized PROUD for 14 weeks in the process of learning design. Problem Solving Inventory was used as a research instrument and appeared valid and reliable to measure the changes. A pretest was administered at the beginning of the course and a posttest after the learning completed. Changes in the students’ perceptions of their problem solving ability were gauged using the rack and stack analysis. A paired sample t-test was also included in the data analysis. The result of the pretest and posttest were −0.147±1.554 logits and −0.749±0.980 logits, respectively. These findings indicate that the perceptions of the students on their ability to solve problems have increased significantly after using the PROUD (paired sample t-test, p = 0.032). These have proven that the use of PROUD changes the students’ perception on their problem solving ability throughout the learning process of design. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Cognitive impairments are features of many psychiatric disorders and affect functioning. A barrier to cognitive research on psychiatric disorders is the lack of large cross-disorder data sets. However, the collection of cognitive data can be logistically challenging and expensive. Web-based collection may be an alternative; however, little is known about who does and does not complete web-based cognitive assessments for psychiatric research. Objective: The aims of this study are to develop a web-based cognitive battery for use in psychiatric research, validate the battery against the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery, and compare the characteristics of the participants who chose to take part with those of the individuals who did not participate. Methods: Tasks were developed by The Many Brains Project and selected to measure the domains specified by the MATRICS initiative. We undertook a cross-validation study of 65 participants with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, or no history of psychiatric disorders to compare the web-based tasks with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery. Following validation, we invited participants from 2 large ongoing genetic studies, which recruited participants with psychiatric disorders to complete the battery and evaluated the demographic and clinical characteristics of those who took part. Results: Correlations between web-based and MATRICS tasks ranged between 0.26 and 0.73. Of the 961 participants, 887 (92.3%) completed at least one web-based task, and 644 (67%) completed all tasks, indicating adequate completion rates. Predictors of web-based participation included being female (odds ratio [OR] 1.3, 95% CI 1.07-1.58), ethnicity other than White European (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.96), higher levels of education (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.11-1.29), diagnosis of an eating disorder (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.17-4) or depression and anxiety (OR 5.12, 95% CI 3.38-7.83), and absence of a diagnosis of schizophrenia (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.94). Lower performance on the battery was associated with poorer functioning (B=−1.76, SE 0.26; P<.001). Conclusions: Our findings offer valuable insights into the advantages and disadvantages of testing cognitive function remotely for mental health research. ©Amy Joanne Lynham, Ian R Jones, James T R Walters.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The European University Association (EUA) defines “employability” as a major goal of higher education. Therefore, competence-based orientation is an important aspect of education. The representation of a standardized job profile in the field of medical informatics, which is based on the most common labor market requirements, is fundamental for identifying and conveying the learning goals corresponding to these competences. Methods: To identify the most common requirements, we extracted 544 job advertisements from the German job portal, STEPSTONE. This process was conducted via a program we developed in R with the “rvest” library, utilizing web crawling, web extraction, and text mining. After removing duplicates and filtering for jobs that required a bachelor's degree, 147 job advertisements remained, from which we extracted qualification terms. We categorized the terms into six groups: professional expertise, soft skills, teamwork, processes, learning, and problem-solving abilities. Results: The results showed that only 45% of the terms are related to professional expertise, while 55% are related to soft skills. Studies of employee soft skills have shown similar results. The most prevalent terms were programming, experience, project, and server. Our second major finding is the importance of experience, further underlining how essential practical skills are. Conclusions: Previous studies used surveys and narrative descriptions. This is the first study to use web crawling, web extraction, and text mining. Our research shows that soft skills and specialist knowledge carry equal weight. The insights gained from this study may be of assistance in developing curricula for medical informatics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Active student participation is critical to the delivery of medicinal chemistry components of the pharmacy school curriculum. Carefully structured active learning strategies can promote student engagement while increasing course material application. Topic-based active learning assignments can be administered, where learners apply constructed knowledge and skills to complete assignments. The suspension of on-campus classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic prompted the development of innovative ways to deliver active learning assignments without using the school's physical team rooms. To actively engage learners, the Zoom video teleconferencing platform with breakout rooms was used to conduct medicinal chemistry active learning assignments in a Pharmacotherapeutics IV: Endocrinology course. The students' assignment scores showed no significant difference when assignments were conducted virtually using Zoom breakout rooms versus on campus, suggesting successful virtual administration of the assignments and students' prompt adaptation to the new environment. The combination of Zoom-based lectures with actively facilitated Zoom breakout room assignments is an effective active learning strategy.

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to assess learning outcomes and the process of developing skill sets of online problem-based learning (PBL) for students majoring in science and engineering at a technical university in Japan. PBL course for first-year undergraduate students was organized with international students as teaching assistants (TAs) to find issues and solutions of the target countries. Due to the effects of COVID-19, the course was completely shifted online in the 2020 academic year. Topics selected by group members were all in line with sustainable development goals (SDGs). Three skill sets to be developed through this PBL course are global awareness, problem-solving and finding, and multicultural communication and understanding. A series of analyses on text mining and content analysis was conducted of essays and reports submitted by students registered for the course. This paper summarizes the structure and pedagogy of the course, research methods, research results and reasons for findings. Research results indicated that all three skill sets were well developed in students through this online PBL course by conducting a study of selected countries with group members, carefully listening to other groups’ presentations in the class, conducting data analysis and online interviews, and communicating with TAs in English. Based on the findings, efforts to maintain quality education in conducting online PBL are also discussed. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background: eHealth tools have the potential to meet the mental health needs of individuals who experience barriers to accessing in-person treatment. However, most users have less than optimal engagement with eHealth tools. Coaching from peer specialists may increase their engagement with eHealth. Objective: This pilot study aims to test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, completely automated web-based system to recruit, screen, enroll, assess, randomize, and then deliver an intervention to a national sample of military veterans with unmet mental health needs; investigate whether phone-based peer support increases the use of web-based problem-solving training compared with self-directed use; and generate hypotheses about potential mechanisms of action for problem-solving and peer support for future full-scale research. Methods: Veterans (N=81) with unmet mental health needs were recruited via social media advertising and enrolled and randomized to the self-directed use of a web-based problem-solving training called Moving Forward (28/81, 35%), peer-supported Moving Forward (27/81, 33%), or waitlist control (26/81, 32%). The objective use of Moving Forward was measured with the number of log-ins. Participants completed pre- and poststudy measures of mental health symptoms and problem-solving confidence. Satisfaction was also assessed post treatment. Results: Automated recruitment, enrollment, and initial assessment methods were feasible and resulted in a diverse sample of veterans with unmet mental health needs from 38 states. Automated follow-up methods resulted in 46% (37/81) of participants completing follow-up assessments. Peer support was delivered with high fidelity and was associated with favorable participant satisfaction. Participants randomized to receive peer support had significantly more Moving Forward log-ins than those of self-directed Moving Forward participants, and those who received peer support had a greater decrease in depression. Problem-solving confidence was associated with greater Moving Forward use and improvements in mental health symptoms among participants both with and without peer support. Conclusions: Enrolling and assessing individuals in eHealth studies without human contact is feasible; however, different methods or designs are necessary to achieve acceptable participant engagement and follow-up rates. Peer support shows potential for increasing engagement in web-based interventions and reducing symptoms. Future research should investigate when and for whom peer support for eHealth is helpful. Problem-solving confidence should be further investigated as a mechanism of action for web-based problem-solving training. © Kyle Possemato, Justina Wu, Carolyn Greene, Rex MacQueen, Daniel Blonigen, Michael Wade, Jason Owen, Terence Keane, Deborah Brief, Steven Lindley, Annabel Prins, Margaret-Anne Mackintosh, Eve Carlson.},

While many pedagogical techniques involving active learning have been established in STEM major courses, their use within STEM general education courses for non-majors are not as well-established. The recently developed GE course at UCLA (termed Chemistry 3: Material World) utilized high-impact practices to introduce students to the scientific process and impart skills of critical thinking and scientific communication through its flexible activities and assignments. Emphasis was placed on collaborative learning, problem-solving, and interpreting scientific information from published reports. Additionally, content focused on social justice and community engagement was introduced throughout several topics (e.g., underrepresentation in science, war on drugs, nuclear proliferation, pollution, and global climate change) to showcase that chemistry is intricately related to bigger societal challenges. This article details our efforts in achieving the course learning outcomes and shares tangible results regarding the assessment of our teaching strategies from student feedback and reflections. We envision that this work will assist faculty in designing inclusive chemistry GE courses that focus on process versus content and adopting our teaching strategies in both in-person and online classrooms.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.

	abstract = {The techniques learned in a laboratory translate into strong critical thinking aptitudes as well as adeptness in complex problem-solving within research. Typically, these laboratory skills are not acquired until a budding scientist enters graduate school since many undergraduate laboratories are more procedural than investigative. Therefore, the module in discussion was designed to aid students in developing competence toward thinking like a scientist. Through utilization of an inquiry-based approach, a laboratory involving high performance liquid chromatography was transformed into a blended online learning experiment. While students were provided in-class time to interact with their peers and the instructor and TA, the majority of the work and development was done outside of class. All background information and protocols were provided outside of the lab via an online course management system including the PowerPoint videos that students used to prepare for the experiment. The students used those materials to ultimately determine the identity and number of different steroids in an unknown sample. The objective was to determine if this approach promoted the metacognitive skills of students and encourage the use of argumentative skills when presenting and justifying claims and data. © 2017 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: With the availability and capabilities of varied technologically enhanced learning activities, the blended learning approach has become increasingly popular in interprofessional education. The combined use of different technologically enhanced learning activities has not been fully examined, particularly to determine the effects of instructional sequences for effective learning outcomes. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate whether the instructional sequences of a blended learning approach can improve students' learning outcomes on interprofessional competencies. Methods: A randomized controlled study was conducted with 40 interprofessional health care teams. These teams undertook three technologically enhanced learning activities - Web-based instruction (WI), virtual reality (VR), and simulation exercise (SE) - after random assignment to three groups based on three different instructional sequences (WI-VR-SE, WI-SE-VR, and SE-WI-VR). Pretests and posttests were conducted to evaluate the students' learning outcomes on interprofessional competencies. Results: A total of 198 participants from the three groups completed the questionnaires. All three groups reported significant improvement in their levels of self-efficacy (P<.05) and attitudes (P<.001) toward interprofessional team care about 1 month after the interprofessional learning activity. Although no significant difference was found (P=.06) between the WI-VR-SE and WI-SE-VR groups in the self-efficacy posttests, participants in the SE-WI-VR group reported significantly lower (P<.05) posttest scores than those in the WI-SE-VR group. The majority of the participants (137/198, 69.1%) selected the instructional sequence "WI-VR-SE" as their top preference. Conclusions: This study shows that the instructional sequence of a blended learning approach can have a significant impact on students' learning outcomes. The learning of concepts from WI followed by problem-solving activity in the SE was found to be a more effective learning sequence than the reverse sequence. We recommend that future studies focus on scaffolding students' learning when planning instructional sequences for technologically enhanced learning activities within blended learning environments. © 2019 Sok Ying Liaw, Khoon Kiat Tan, Ling Ting Wu, Seng Chee Tan, Hyekyung Choo, John Yap, Sok Mui Lim, Lilian Wong, Jeanette Ignacio.},

	abstract = {Chemistry educators around the world have had to introduce innovative approaches for engaging students through virtual chemistry laboratory exercises, both out of necessity and to complement traditional in-person learning. As new methods are explored, instructors strive to offer experiences that are engaging and accessible and that foster skills transferable to in-person laboratories. Here, we introduce a method for designing virtual laboratory exercises using existing survey platforms, namely Microsoft Forms and Google Forms. These platforms offer the ability to integrate media content (e.g., videos and images) and questions which allow instructors to scaffold experiments with targeted inquiries as well as to encourage students to make decisions by the incorporation of branching points where the outcome(s) of the experiment can vary based on the selections chosen by students. Additionally, they are accessible to both teachers and students and offer instructors the flexibility to customize their virtual experiences to support their course learning outcomes. These exercises can also be easily shared and modified between instructors and potentially complement future in-person laboratories. © 2022 The Authors.

Technology, including computer-assisted instruction, plays an important role in today’s dynamic learning environments. Currently, there is a lack of computer-assisted intervention programs that systematically teach generalized word problem-solving skills that are driven by mathematical models. Model-based problem solving (MBPS) is one of the essential emphases in the Common Core mathematical practice standards. This study investigated the effects of a web-based computer tutor, MBPS, on enhancing word problem-solving performance of elementary students who are struggling in mathematics. The MBPS tutor incorporates best practices that are identified by the Institute of Educational Sciences’ (IES) latest practice guide, including providing systematic instruction, visual and verbal supports, and teaching of precise mathematical language. Findings indicate that the MBPS tutor boosted participants’ performance above and beyond the business-as-usual comparison group. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2023.},

	abstract = {In synchronously-delivered, multisite classrooms, the physical separation between distance students and instructors may create a perceived divide that negatively affects learning. Building on prior experience in flipping organic chemistry in single-site face-to-face (F2F) classes, we decided to extend our approach to multisite, synchronously delivered general chemistry courses. Our thought was to narrow the perceived instructor-student divide in distance teaching by using the flexible in-class time that flipping affords to increase the number of positive teacher/distance-student interactions. In this effort, we gradually developed a technique called “bridging questions,” through which the instructor becomes more familiar with student interests and then connects those interests to chemistry topics discussed in class. Despite anticipating overall positive results, actual consequences were mixed: after flipping the class, evaluation scores and positive feedback increased slightly. However, the mean final exam scores decreased for F2F students by 26.2% but increased for distance students by 4.4% (not statistically significant). Thus, this new approach (flipping with bridging questions) may have unintentionally skewed our focus to distance students, though this conclusion is speculative. (We acknowledge statistical limitations, due to small sample sizes.) We accordingly advocate proactive efforts to balance engagement between both F2F and distance sites. In this paper we also discuss modifications we made to adapt our flipped format to multisite, synchronously delivered freshman chemistry courses, as well as the basic idea of bridging questions in general. © 2017 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

A new electron-pushing formalism analytic framework was developed from a review of the literature in addition to analysis of students' interview artifacts, using a constant-comparison process. Utilization of this new electron-pushing formalism analytic framework for coding student interview artifacts revealed that cPLTL students were significantly less likely to successfully draw the product suggested by the curved arrows than their PLTL classmates. Implications for instructors are suggested, including encouraging students to verbally explain their rationale while drawing mechanisms as well as optimizing graphical collaborative learning activities for online learners. © 2018 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

The lab is based on the exploration of the thermal effects of molecular absorption of infrared radiation by greenhouse and non-greenhouse gases. A novel feature of the experiment has students building an infrared spectrometer, using a hot plate as an IR source, a sample compartment employing a plastic cuvette holder with open sides (to standardize the path length), and a low-cost infrared thermometer. Students, working in groups, (1) explore a PhET simulation; (2) design a set of experiments in response to a scientific question, "comparing the absorption of infrared light in the presence and absence of each different sample of gas, are there any significant differences that can be observed experimentally?" (3) reflect on climate science and their experimental results by visiting the American Chemical Society Climate Science Toolkit; and (4) communicate their results in lab by constructing and presenting a poster. Assessment of student responses to a pre- and postexperiment question suggests that the lab has a positive influence on student understanding of the concepts involved in identifying greenhouse gases. Results from postexperiment questions also provide information for what aspects of the online resources students found useful. © 2016 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual reality simulation, including web-based simulation, has increased in nursing education. This study explored nursing students' self-directed problem-solving in web-based virtual simulation experiences. Method: Convenience sampling yielded 16 Korean senior nursing students who had experienced clinical practice in the last semester. Data were collected from August 2020 to January 2021 through in-depth Zoom video interviews and organized using NVivo version 12.0. Thematic analysis was applied to analyze the data. Results: The following four themes were identified from nursing students' learning experiences during the web-based virtual simulations: “self-awareness of a lack of nursing competency in virtual reality,” “applying new learning strategies learned from failure,” “voluntary learning behavior,” and “cognitive shift toward a holistic understanding.” Web-based virtual simulations activated various cognitive and metacognitive factors of self-directed learning, and the system's prompt feedback and students' reflections facilitated learning effects. Nursing students corrected their cognitive errors while learning from their failures and mistakes and gained a holistic view of nursing practice. Conclusion: In this study, web-based self-directed learning activated the metacognition of nursing students in a virtuous cycle. The virtual environment with no actual harm to the patient has become a space for learners to experience a sense of confidence, achievement, and satisfaction. Web-based virtual simulation can be an effective teaching method to improve nursing students' self-directed learning abilities and nursing competency. © 2022 Japan Academy of Nursing Science.},

	abstract = {Chemical escape rooms (ChEsRms) are educational games in which students use their brain, chemical knowledge, intuition, and a bit of luck to solve a mystery. At the Weizmann Institute, we have developed ChEsRms that are implemented by teachers in their classes. Since the COVID-19 pandemic stopped all the educational activities that took place in physical space, we decided to design a virtual ChEsRm (VChEsRm) that is fully conducted in digital space. We describe the design principles that characterize the VChEsRm and present the students' and teachers' perceptions of the VChEsRm and how it differs from the ChEsRm. We describe "The Masked Scientist", a VChEsRm in which students must identify a scientist using their knowledge of basic topics in the chemistry syllabus: the model of the atom, radioactivity, and the periodic table. This VChEsRm has added values, a connection to history, human rights, and sustainability, as well as interesting and surprising chemical facts related to everyday life. Since it is conducted in virtual space, it could also include experiments, procedures, and materials that are dangerous and therefore forbidden in a physical ChEsRm or that could even change the course of history. Importantly, this 90 min activity includes the VChEsRm (9 puzzles) and a 45 min follow-up session that deals with the ideas behind the puzzles. It was translated from Hebrew to Arabic and English; therefore, high school and general chemistry teachers around the world can easily use the VChEsRm in their class after reading this paper by clicking on the link. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

	abstract = {Chemistry education research demonstrates the value of open-ended writing tasks, such as writing-to-learn (WTL) assignments, for supporting students’ learning with topics including reasoning about reaction mechanisms. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, such as chatbots ChatGPT and Bard, raises concerns regarding the value of open-ended writing tasks in the classroom; one concern involves academic integrity and whether students will use these chatbots to produce sufficient responses to open-ended writing tasks. The present study investigates the degree to which generative AI chatbots exhibit mechanistic reasoning in response to organic chemistry WTL assignments. We produced responses from three generative AI chatbots (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Bard) to two WTL assignments developed to elicit students’ mechanistic reasoning. Using previously reported machine learning models for analyzing student writing in response to the WTL assignments, we analyzed the chatbot responses for the inclusion of features pertinent to mechanistic reasoning. Herein, we report quantitative analyses of (1) the differences between chatbot responses on the two assignments and (2) the differences between chatbot and authentic student responses. Findings indicate that chatbots respond differently to different WTL assignments. Additionally, the chatbots rarely incorporated the discussion of electron movement, a key feature of mechanistic reasoning. Furthermore, the chatbots, in general, do not engage in mechanistic reasoning at the same level as students. We contextualize the results by considering academic integrity with the assumption that students’ intentions are to engage in academically honest behavior, and we focus on understanding the ethical uses of generative AI for classroom assignments. © 2023 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

	abstract = {Introduction Young people (aged 10-25 years) with chronic diseases are vulnerable to have reduced social participation and quality of life. It is important to empower young people to engage in their chronic diseases self-management. In comparison with traditional face-to-face care, interventions delivered through the internet and related technologies (eHealth) are less stigmatising and more accessible. Gamified eHealth self-management interventions may be particularly promising for young people. This systematic review aims at identifying (1) the game mechanics that have been implemented in eHealth interventions to support young people's self-management of their chronic (somatic or psychiatric) diseases, (2) the investigators' rationale for implementing such game mechanics and, if possible, (3) the effects of these interventions. Methods and analysis The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis statement guidelines will be followed. A systematic search of the literature will be conducted in Embase, Psycinfo and Web of Science from inception until 30 August 2022. Studies will be eligible if focused on (1) young people (aged 10-25 years) with chronic diseases and (2) describing gamified eHealth self-management interventions. When possible, the effects of the gamified interventions will be compared with non-gamified interventions or care-as-usual. Primary quantitative, qualitative or mixed-method studies written in English will be included. Two independent reviewers will (1) select studies, (2) extract and summarise the implemented game mechanics as well as the characteristics of the intervention and study, (3) evaluate their methodological quality and (4) synthesise the evidence. The reviewers will reach a consensus through discussion, and if required, a third researcher will be consulted. Ethics and dissemination As systematic reviews use publicly available data, no formal ethical review and approval are needed. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at conferences and communicated to relevant stakeholders including patient organisations via the eHealth Junior Consortium.

	abstract = {At present, there is a wide variety of teaching methods and educational strategies mediated by technology: e-learning, m-learning, b-learning, gamification, flipped classroom, bring your own devices (BYOD), etc. This methodological variety creates an important student-participation space where challenges, problem solving and collaboration are put to the testing. Due to the need for communication, portability and ubiquity, several of these methods use mobile devices to achieve their goal. Laptops, smartphones and tablets, with access to wireless networks, can be used to improve teacher–student interaction and thereby stimulate students’ motivation, participation and active learning. Gamification is a teaching-learning strategy, which incorporates knowledge based on games that can support and mostly motivate the work of students and teachers. This document presents the results of a study using the Kahoot Platform, which is a web service of social and gamified education learning, in order to create evaluations changed into games of knowledge and competition among students. When it is used as a questionnaire, it challenges users to answer the questions posed, with a controlled response time, accumulated points, badges and a podium with the first five places. This leads to an active and dynamic learning due to the strong playful component, competitive and teamwork. The results of the research indicate that students improved participation and motivation in classes, besides checking that they had better results when working with mobile devices. These data will allow to analyze future perspectives about the use of the learning platform based on games as an assistance in the teaching-learning process. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {The growing popularity of flipped, blended, and online learning, combined with the need to support a student population with increasingly diverse backgrounds, has led to the development and use of online materials to support students' learning of chemistry outside of a face-to-face classroom. Chemistry simulations provide opportunities to make such materials more interactive; however, it is important to understand how to best employ them to support students' independent learning outside of the classroom. The larger ChemSims project aims to determine how screencasts and simulations can be used to best support the development of students' conceptual understanding of core chemistry concepts in such environments. This paper focuses specifically on the concepts of force and energy as they pertain to bonding and intermolecular attractions. It describes the investigation of students' out-of-class use of a PhET simulation that illustrates force and energy changes that occur when two atoms come together or are separated. As an introduction to bonding, students completed out-of-class assignment questions in one of three different treatment conditions: (1) exploring the simulation directly using guided instructions; (2) watching an expert-narrated screencast using the same simulation; or (3) watching an "enhanced screencast", consisting of the expert-narrated screencast plus additional information related to the formation and breaking of bonds in chemical reactions. Comparing scores on pretest and follow-up questions indicated that all treatments resulted in small learning gains with some learning objectives indicating greater gains than others. Further, findings indicate that the enhanced screencast was able to help students better connect this concept to the phenomena of ATP hydrolysis. Finally, using eye tracking to contrast student use of the simulation as compared to the screencast in completing the assignment suggests that, while the screencast may not result in increased conceptual gains, it may serve to make the assignment seem easier than if students are required to engage with the simulation themselves to work through the initial questions.  © },

	abstract = {Collaborative problem-solving skills are one of the key competencies required in the twenty-first century. In this study, researchers attempted to compare the effectiveness of web-based collaborative problem-solving systems (wCPSS) and classroom-based collaborative hands-on learning activities (cCHLA) in the development of collaborative problem-solving skills in junior high school students who were learning science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related subjects. A quasi-experimental, nonequivalent pretest–posttest control group design was employed, and 241 junior high school students were invited to participate in the study. According to the results, a wCPSS-supported environment with teacher guidance was found to be more effective than either a wCPSS-supported environment without teacher guidance or a cCHLA-facilitated environment in developing students’ collaborative problem-solving skills in STEM fields. The study suggested that a web-based collaborative problem-solving system with teacher guidance can be used in developing junior high students’ collaborative problem-solving skills in STEM education. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {An online module for final-year master’s students has been developed over a 5-year period. The module allows equitable experiences for students studying in person at the University of York, at a university abroad, or undertaking an industrial placement. Distinctively, the module was designed around the use of modern research papers, published by Chemistry at York researchers, as vehicles of information. The approach allowed students to apply chemical principles learned in earlier years of their course to the solution of problems at the forefront of five chemistry specialisms, ranging from atmospheric and environmental, to physical chemistry. Learning objectives included an appreciation of the experimental and analytical techniques used in the research, as well as the development of scientific literacy and critical thinking skills. There was also an opportunity for students to develop communication skills through an optional competition. Staff collaborated with students as partners in the development of course content, as well as establishing student workload, and testing formative assessments. Student attitudes toward the module were monitored, which demonstrated an enthusiasm for the approach and coverage of material. The flexibility to work through the content at their own pace, at a time to suit them, was appreciated by students as a whole and highlighted in disabled students’ feedback. Challenges remain in engaging students to learn theoretical courses while wanting to focus on their individual capstone research projects. Assessment of students’ problem-solving skills by an in-person or online examination resulted in a consistent examination performance. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {This study examines whether asking students to critique incorrect solutions to decimal problems based on common misconceptions can help them learn about decimals better than asking them to solve the same problems and receive feedback. In a web-based tutoring system, 208 middle school students either had to identify, explain, and correct errors made by a fictional student (erroneous examples group) or solve isomorphic versions of the problems with feedback (problem-solving group). Although the two groups did not differ significantly on an immediate posttest, students in the erroneous examples group performed significantly better on a delayed posttest administered one week later (d =.62). Students in the erroneous examples group also were more accurate at judging whether their posttest answers were correct (d =.49). Students in the problem-solving group reported higher satisfaction with the materials than those in the erroneous examples group, indicating that liking instructional materials does not equate to learning from them. Overall, practice in identifying, explaining, and correcting errors may help students process decimal problems at a deeper level, and thereby help them overcome misconceptions and build a lasting understanding of decimals. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Two experiments were performed in this study. In study 1, an experiment on 103 elementary and high school teachers (the learning activity designers) has been conducted to understand their views toward an electronic library-based learning environment. The results showed that with this innovative approach, electronic libraries not only have the potential to support traditional in-class learning, but also can assist teachers in developing learning activities for training students in web-based problem-solving abilities. Moreover, teachers of different ages and backgrounds all readily accepted the new approach, in particular, the older and more experienced teachers showed even higher willingness to use the system than the younger and less experienced teachers. In study 2, a quasi-experiment on 62 elementary school students (experimental group with 31 students and control group with 31 students) has been undertaken on a natural science course for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Experimental results showed that this innovative approach can improve the students' learning achievements and attitudes in comparisons with the conventional web-based learning approach. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).},

	abstract = {Blended learning, thoughtfully combining the best elements of online and face-to-face education, is likely to emerge as the predominant teaching model of the future. In this paper, we present a blended learning environment combining mobile learning, web-based learning, and classroom teaching to provide realistic, practical opportunities for learners and teachers to engage in problem solving activities. The purpose of this study was to explore problem solving patterns and their impact on learning achievement in a blended learning environment. Through quasi-experimental instruction, we collected all of the data of the learning processes from 34 students in a blended learning environment using classroom instruction, mobile and web scenarios. By combining cluster analysis and content analysis, we were able to identify three groups with distinct characteristics: the hybrid-oriented group, the technology-oriented group, and the efficiency-oriented group. Learners in the hybrid-oriented group used the classroom, mobile and web scenario almost equally. They displayed a regular manner in following the instructor's teaching procedure, and tended to passively accept whatever the teacher said. Students in the technology-oriented group spent most of their time using mobile and web technologies but they revealed superficial problem solving abilities such as a lack of understanding and planning. The efficiency-oriented group was characterized by the efficient monitoring of learning processes. It was more task-oriented and performed better than the other two groups. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a common experiment in upper-level undergraduate biochemistry, molecular biology, and forensic laboratory courses as reagents and thermocyclers have become more affordable for institutions. Typically, instructors design PCR primers to amplify the region of interest and the students prepare their samples for PCR and analyze the results. However, primers can also be designed in undergraduate laboratories with students at this level. In a course that focuses on forensic DNA molecular biology for forensic chemistry students, students have used the Applied Biosystems AmpFlSTR SGM Plus kit that amplifies DNA at eleven regions in a single test tube. It is important for forensic chemistry students to be able to design and analyze a single set of primers and, more importantly, create multiplexes of primers. This enables students to more fully understand how the primers and the kits that are routinely employed by the crime laboratories function. Creating a single set of primers does not demonstrate the extent of design and engineering inherent in creating multiplexes or adequately prepare students for research and careers in the field. The in silico method described herein uses free bioinformatics tools and results in student-designed multiplexes for Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) loci. Sample student data are shown.},

	abstract = {Nearly 100 years ago de Donder introduced the term "extent of reaction", ξ. We build on that work by defining the concept of reagent extrema for an arbitrary chemical reaction, aA + bB â‡ yY + zZ. The central equation is ξîi = -n i,0/νi. The symbol ξîi represents the reagent extremum for the chemical entity i; ni,0 represents the initial molar amount of entity i, and νi is its stoichiometric number, which is positive for products and negative for reactants. A reagent extremum exists for each reactant and each product; those of reactants are zero or positive, and the least positive of these is the reaction extremum to the right, ξmax; those of products are zero or negative, and the least negative is the reaction extremum to the left, ξmin. These two boundary values, called reaction extrema, indicate the maximum extent to which the reaction can progress in the forward or reverse direction, respectively. The ξmax and ξmin values are an important pedagogical tool for a quantitative understanding of chemical reaction stoichiometry. A graphical presentation in which the amounts of reagents are depicted versus extent of reaction is useful for helping general chemistry students understand intuitively the extent to which chemical reactions can progress. The Supporting Information includes a student handout, a student exercise, and a Web-enhanced object, Reaction Progress, which can be used to help students understand the concept of extent of reaction and reaction extrema. © 2013 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

Consequently, the expert system works as an instructor to assist the students in improving their web-based problem-solving ability.

Three experimental conditions (teacher-enhanced scaffolding, technology-enhanced scaffolding, and both forms of scaffolding) were compared with a control condition in a two-by-two factorial quasi-experimental design. Moreover, gender and prior knowledge were examined as two factors which may have a significant impact on Web-based learning. In a four-week field study in secondary science education, pretest-posttest differences were measured. In total 347 students from 18 secondary school classes were involved and the classes were randomly distributed over the 4 conditions. Our findings support the notion of multiple scaffolding as an approach to enhance both knowledge acquisition and metacognitive awareness with respect to IPSprocesses and to meet a mix of students with different needs within the context of a web-based inquiry learning project. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on a study of learning with erroneous examples, mathematical problems presented to students in which one or more of the steps are incorrect. It is hypothesized that such examples can deepen student understanding of mathematics content, yet very few empirical studies have tested this in classrooms settings. In a classroom study, 255 6th, 7th, and 8th graders learned about decimals using a web-based system under one of three conditions - erroneous examples, worked examples, and partially-supported problem solving. Although students' performance improved significantly from pretest to posttest the learning effect for erroneous examples was not better than the other conditions, and unlike some earlier empirical work, the higher prior knowledge students did not benefit more from erroneous examples than from worked examples or problem solving. On the other hand, we were able to identify certain key decimal misconceptions that are held by a high percentage of students, confirming earlier mathematics education studies. Also, the incidence of misconceptions declined over the course of the lesson, especially for the worked example group. Overall, these results could indicate that erroneous examples are simply not as effective for learning as we (and other) researchers hypothesize. The results could also indicate that the manner in which erroneous examples were presented to the students in this study somehow missed the mark in promoting learning. It is also possible that erroneous examples, like some other e-learning techniques, do not work as well in classroom as they do in a laboratory setting. We discuss these possibilities and how we are redesigning the treatments to be more focused and appealing to learners for a subsequent study. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The computational method developed in this study approximates the posterior distribution of the student's ability obtained from the conventional Bayes Modal Estimation (BME) approach to a simple Gaussian function in order to reduce the amount of computations required in the subsequent ability update processes. To verify the correctness and usefulness of this method, the abilities of 407 college students who solved 61 physics problems in a Web-based learning environment were estimated from the log files of the learning environment. The reduced chi-squared statistic and Pearson's chi-square test for the goodness of fit indicate that the estimated abilities were able to successfully explain the observed problem solving performance of students within error. The educational implications of estimating the ability of students in Web-based learning environments were also discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Moreover, an experiment was conducted on 80 freshmen from two classes of a university to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach improved the students' web-based problem solving performance in comparison with the conventional approach in terms of "problem finding" and "idea finding." Moreover, it was found that the proposed approach could improve the "fact finding" performance of the students with intuitive-type cognitive style. Accordingly, some implications and suggestions are given for educators who attempt to conduct web-based problem-solving activity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The questions in the tutorial are tiered to simulate the pyramidal structure of knowledge and interlinked to form concept maps required to aid student learning. Visual cues and remedial exercises are linked to advanced questions to facilitate integration of knowledge. Students advance through lower levels to reach higher levels at their own pace. This Web-based learning program provides flexible delivery for the learner and records the learning history of an individual user for the instructor. The diagnostic information helps with reflective teaching and facilitates independence of the learner.

	abstract = {To meet the information literacy (IL) needs of chemistry students, The College of New Jersey's (TCNJ) Library and Chemistry Departments have created a three-year seminar with a strong IL component. The program focuses on IL skills necessary for success in industry and graduate or professional education, but may lack features specific to those students becoming secondary school educators. In order to determine whether there is a need for additions to the program, TCNJ librarians inquired about information literacy with current secondary education chemistry teachers in the United States. Through a survey, the researchers investigated the participants' perceived value of IL, the skills emphasized in high school chemistry curricula, potential difficulties in embedding IL skills, and the types of resources available to high school chemistry teachers and students. Fifty-five percent of survey participants reported that there is a moderate to high priority for IL in their chemistry curriculum. Ninety-two percent responded that students search the Internet for chemistry information. The researchers also reviewed literature about IL standards, curriculum standards in secondary education science, the importance of critical thinking skills, and the IL skills of K-12 students and teachers. The results of the survey and the review of the literature show that there is an opportunity to equip our secondary education chemistry majors with an IL pedagogy so that they can, in turn, effectively instill in their future high school students the values and habits exhibited by critical consumers of scientific information. © 2015 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

	abstract = {In this paper the problem of rectangular islands was investigated. We advocate that the topic is particularly suitable for teaching in different levels. First, the occurring problems are part of current mathematical research with still open problems. This could motivate our talented students for active autonomous problem solving and bring the groups of researchers, educators and students closer. The presented computer supported tools enable an emphasis shift from the frontal teaching to project based, self-paced or active small group learning. By manipulating the size of the grid, the water level, or the height of a cell with suitable graphical interface elements, the learner becomes an active part of the discovery and learning process. The introduced graphical representations can be studied dynamically and parallel with the interactive demonstrations and games designed by the authors. The concrete representations, and constructions can facilitate the discovery of patterns and can lead to invention of general conjectures. In fact, the authors of the paper ourselves found some results in 4.1-2.4 in this way. We computed values for several small fixed sized grids, detected patterns for establishing a recursion and finally resolved them. For the investigation of integer sequences there are built-in functions in computer algebra systems like Mathematica, or there is a web resource, an online encyclopedia for looking up interesting integer sequences by just knowing their first few entries (http://www.research.att.com/~njas/ sequences/). The experimental activity complements, but does not replace, the essential part of the mathematical activity: the rigorous theorem proving. For doing so, we used some elementary results from the theory of linear recurrences and graphs and applied induction and the method of two-sided estimation. We deduced the maximal number of islands in the rectangular grid with the latter techniques. We note that we are going to use the Theorema proving system (Windsteiger et al. 2006) for supporting the formulation of the predicates and functions of the island theory in a more formal language and for facilitating the computation and proving phase of the exploration with computers. It is noted that even if the obtained lower and upper bounds would have been different, the efforts for establishing those bounds are not in vain and there is no a priori guarantee that the exact solution has a nice closed form. In fact, if the number of triangular islands in a grid with size n is denoted by f(n), according to Horváth et al. (2009), it is "only" known that n2+3n 5 ≤ f (n) ≤ n2+9n+2 14 . The grid and cell model we have considered can also be a link between different disciplines. There are other examples requiring only m 9 n cells on a rectangular grid; for example, aij may mean a colour on a gray-scale (before we convert the picture to black and white), transparency (against X-rays), or melting temperature. The technique of gradual increase of the water level is applied successfully in medical image processing (Beucher and Lantuejoul 1979). This outlook may also motivate our students to consider mathematics not as an abstract sterile world, but rather as the general technique of systematic problem solving with real applications. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a near-optimal allocation method for web-based multi-player online role-playing games (MORPGs), which must be able to cope with a large number of users and high frequency of user re-quests. Our previous work introduced a dynamic data reallocation method. It uses multiple web servers and divides the entire game world into small blocks. Each ownership of block is allocated to a web server. Additionally, the ownership is reallocated to the other web server according to the user's requests. Furthermore, this block allocation was formulated as a combi-national optimization problem. And a simulation based experiment with an exact algorithm showed that our system could achieve 31% better than an ad-hoc approach. However, the exact algorithm takes too much time to solve a problem when the problem size is large. This paper proposes a meta-heuristic approach based on a tabu search to solve a problem quickly. A simulation result shows that our tabu search algorithm can generate so-lutions, whose average correctness is only 1% different from that of the exact algorithm. In addition, the average calculation time for 50 users on a system with five web servers is about 25.67 msec while the exact algorithm takes about 162 msec. An evaluation for a web-based MORPG system with our tabu search shows that it could achieve 420 users capacity while 320 for our previous system. © 2013 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

Moreover, based on the analysis of 170 elementary school students' web information-searching portfolios as well as their feedback to the assessments, questionnaires and interviews, it was found that the students' problem-solving ability and their web-based problem-solving performance were highly correlated, implying that the five-phase learning cycle approach could be able to improve not only the students' web-based problem-solving performance, but also their general problem-solving ability. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).},

There are, however, some inadequacies associated with the implementation of appropriate pedagogy for organised and structured instruction that supports the rational problem-solving paradigm. The purpose of this article is to report on a study for the design and implementation of an Instructional Web Design Programme (IWDP) with methodology-specific guidelines in an information systems design context. A second purpose is to discuss the pedagogy developed within the IWDP and its effects on promoting technological problem solving of learners in the project-based classroom. A qualitative, action-research approach was the basis for this study. The sample consisted of 17 learners at an institution of higher education. The researchers used a focus group interview, journals and essays to observe learners’ behaviour, to analyse their project designs and to assess their opinions and experiences with regard to the IWDP. An organised and structured instructional environment within the IWDP helped the teacher to promote technological problem solving. The teacher and learners acknowledged the components of the programme (for example, assessment criteria, range statements, performance indicators, pre-defined learner tasks and activities) in the project-based classroom. Practical and cognitive apprenticeship and experiential and situated learning were used to accommodate the problem-solving needs of learners.

	abstract = {Purpose: Nursing students should exhibit competence in nursing skills in order to provide safe and quality patient care. This study describes the design and students' response to an interactive web-based course using streaming video technology tailored to students' needs and the course objectives of the fundamentals of nursing skills clinical course. Method: A mixed-methodology design was used to describe the experience of 102 first-year undergraduate nursing students at a school of nursing in Jordan who were enrolled in the course. A virtual course with streaming videos was designed to demonstrate medication administration fundamental skills. The videos recorded the ideal lab demonstration of the skills, and real-world practice performed by registered nurses for patients in a hospital setting. After course completion, students completed a 30-item satisfaction questionnaire, 8 self-efficacy scales, and a 4-item scale solicited their preferences of using the virtual course as a substitute or a replacement of the lab demonstration. Students' grades in the skill examination of the procedures were measured. Relationships between the main variables and predictors of satisfaction and self-efficacy were examined. Results: Students were satisfied with the virtual course (3.9. ±. 0.56, out of a 5-point scale) with a high-perceived overall self-efficacy (4.38. ±. 0.42, out of a 5-point scale). Data showed a significant correlation between student satisfaction, self-efficacy and achievement in the virtual course (r=0.45-0.49, p<. 0.01). The majority of students accessed the course from home and some faced technical difficulties. Significant predictors of satisfaction were ease of access the course and gender (B=0.35, 0.25, CI=0.12-0.57, 0.02-0.48 respectively). The mean achievement score of students in the virtual class (7.5. ±. 0.34) was significantly higher than that of a previous comparable cohort who was taught in the traditional method (6.0. ±. 0.23) (p<. 0.05). Nearly 40% of the students believed that the virtual course is a sufficient replacement of the lab demonstration. Conclusions: The use of multimedia within an interactive online learning environment is a valuable teaching strategy that yields a high level of nursing student satisfaction, self-efficacy, and achievement. The creation and delivery of a virtual learning environment with streaming videos for clinical courses is a complex process that should be carefully designed to positively influence the learning experience. However, the learning benefits gained from such pedagogical approach are worth faculty, institution and students' efforts. © 2014.},

	abstract = {Erroneous examples - step-by-step problem solutions with one or more errors for students to find and fix - hold great potential to help students learn. In this study, which is a replication of a prior study (Adams et al. 2014), but with a much larger population (390 vs. 208), middle school students learned about decimals either by working with interactive, web-based erroneous examples or with more traditional supported problems to solve. The erroneous examples group was interactively prompted to find, explain, and fix errors in decimal problems, while the problem-solving group was prompted to solve the same decimal problems and explain their solutions. Both groups were given correctness feedback on their work by the web-based program. Although the two groups did not differ on an immediate post-test, the erroneous examples group performed significantly better on a delayed test, given a week after the initial post-test (d∈=∈.33, for gain scores), replicating the pattern of the prior study. Interestingly, the problem solving group reported liking the intervention more than the erroneous examples group (d∈=∈.21 for liking rating in a questionnaire) and found the user interface easier to interact with (d∈=∈.37), suggesting that what students like does not always lead to the best learning outcomes. This result is consistent with that of desirable difficulty studies, in which a more cognitively challenging learning task results in deeper and longer-lasting learning. © 2015 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.},

	abstract = {With the expanding availability and capability of varied technologies, classroom-based problem solving has become an increasingly attainable, yet still elusive, goal. Evidence of technology-enhanced problem-solving teaching and learning in schools has been scarce, understanding how to support students' problem solving in classroom-based, technology-enhanced learning environments has been limited, and coherent frameworks to guide implementation have been slow to emerge. Whereas researchers have examined the use and impact of scaffolds in mathematics, science, and reading, comparatively little research has focused on scaffolding learning in real-world, everyday classroom settings. Web-based systems have been developed to support problem solving, but implementations suggest variable enactment and inconsistent impact. The purpose of this article is to identify critical issues in scaffolding students' technology-enhanced problem solving in everyday classrooms. First, we examine two key constructs (problem solving and scaffolding) and propose a framework that includes essential dimensions to be considered when teachers scaffold student problem solving in technology-rich classes. We then investigate issues related to peer-, teacher-, and technology-enhanced scaffolds, and conclude by examining implications for research. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

NHI's Web-based Trainings (WBTs), launched in 2007, now reach more than twice as many participants as traditional, in-person Instructor-led Trainings (ILTs). By offering a variety of formats, NHI training participants are empowered to choose the most appropriate training method to suit their learning preferences, budgets, and time. NHI's remote course offerings allow organizations to train an increasingly distributed workforce. To keep participants engaged and encourage collaboration, NHI instructors may introduce interactive segments throughout the training to stimulate discussion and maintain participants' focus over the duration of the course. NHI is experimenting with new learning techniques. In the 'flipped classroom' approach, which NHI is piloting with FHWA's Office of Operations to support internal learning needs, participants complete foundational learning online at their own pace before coming together as a group for engaging discussion and applied problem-solving. NHI and the FHWA's Geotechnical Program Office partnership for the March 2015 virtual training event associated with the International Foundations Congress and Equipment Expo is another example of our innovative approach to training. Virtual technology also is playing a role in some of NHI's Instructor-led Trainings. In the course ‘Safety Inspection of In-Service Bridges,' participants are able to inspect and assess two virtual bridges—a four-span steel bridge over a divided highway and a single-span concrete structure over water.},

	abstract = {In our previous project, an XML-based authoring tool was provided for teachers to script multimedia teaching material with animated agents, and a stand-alone learning system was designed for students to display the material and interact with animated agents. We also provided evidence that the authoring tool and learning system in computer-assisted learning systems successfully enhances learning performance. The aim of this study is to continue the previous project, to develop a Web-based multimedia learning system that presents materials and an animated agent on a Web browser. The Web-based multimedia learning system can provide an opportunity for students to engage in independent learning or review of school course work. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of this learning system, it was applied to one elementary school. An experimental material, 'Road Traffic Safety', was presented in two learning systems: aWeb-based PowerPoint learning system and a Web-based multimedia learning system. The experiment was carried out in two classes that had a total of thirtyone 3rd-grade students. The results suggest that using our authoring tool in a Web-based learning system can improve learning, and in particular, enhance learners' problem-solving ability. Students with higher achievement on the post-test showed better comprehension in problem-solving questions. Furthermore, the feedback from the questionnaire surveys show students' learning interest can be fostered when an animated agent is integrated into multimedia teaching materials, and that students prefer to adopt the Web-based multimedia learning system for independent learning after school. © 2011 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

	abstract = {Background: Case-based learning (CBL) is an effective educational method for improving the learning and clinical reasoning skills of students. Advances in e-learning technology have supported the development of the Web-based CBL approach to teaching as an alternative or supplement to the traditional classroom approach. Purpose: This study aims to examine the CBL experience of Hong Kong students using both traditional classroom and Web-based approaches in undergraduate nursing education. This experience is examined in terms of the perceived self-learning ability, clinical reasoning ability, and satisfaction in learning of these students. Methods: A mixture of quantitative and qualitative approaches was adopted. All Year-3 undergraduate nursing students were recruited. CBL was conducted using the traditional classroom approach in Semester 1, and the Web-based approach was conducted in Semester 2. Student evaluations were collected at the end of each semester using a self-report questionnaire. In-depth, focus-group interviews were conducted at the end of Semester 2. Results: One hundred twenty-two students returned their questionnaires. No difference between the face-to-face and Web-based approaches was found in terms of self-learning ability (p =.947), clinical reasoning ability (p =.721), and satisfaction (p =.083). Focus group interview findings complemented survey findings and revealed five themes that reflected the CBL learning experience of Hong Kong students. These themes were (a) the structure of CBL, (b) the learning environment of Web-based CBL, (c) critical thinking and problem solving, (d) cultural influence on CBL learning experience, and (e) student-centered and teacher-centered learning. Conclusions: The Web-based CBL approach was comparable but not superior to the traditional classroom CBL approach. The Web-based CBL experience of these students sheds light on the impact of Chinese culture on student learning behavior and preferences. © 2016 Taiwan Nurses Association.},

To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, an experiment was conducted on an elementary school natural science course.

	abstract = {This chapter presents an agent-based cognitive model aimed to represent human competency concepts and competencemanagement processes of psychological nature. This model is implemented by a multiagent system application intended to help managers of software development projects to select, based on the competence management model, the right professionals to integrate a development team. There are several software engineeringmethodologies that can be used to design and develop multiagent systems. However, due to the necessity to handle human competency concepts of cognitive nature, like aptitudes, interests, abilities and knowledge, we were driven to choose methodologies that can handle these concepts since the inception of the system. To do so, we integrated the TROPOS methodology, and a set of software engineering methods derived from intelligent tutoring systems research to successfully analyze and design the proposed system. At the end of the paper we present a study case, showing how the proposed system should be applied to the domain of website development. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This work intends to introduce a tool for teaching, evaluating, and assessing computer science students. Kodr is a modular gamified learning platform designed to evaluate varying problem types through gathering data about students performance. We conducted two studies in the wild with more than one thousand students to evaluate the initial design of Kodr. The first study evaluated two methods of teaching. The first method is to solve programming problems from scratch, the second, is to debug an incorrect solution of those problems. The results of the study yielded no significant difference between the two styles. The second study found significant positive correlations between Kodr’s activity data and student’s final course grades. Qualitative feedback gathered from students also evaluated Kodr as quite helpful. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

The participants were 66 college students, and a quasi-experimental research design was employed. This study examined the differences in the learning performance and project performance between participants using the web map mind tool (the experimental group) and ordinary Internet search engines (the control group). The results indicate the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group in terms of both learning performance and project performance. In addition, we found that the students in the two groups held a positive learning attitude toward the project activity of tour planning. In terms of students' attitude toward the use of a mind tool, this study only conducted a survey for the experimental group.

A proposed concept for an "Imploded Boolean Search" combines three unique identifiable field types to perform a search: keyword(s), numerical value(s), and a chemical structure or reaction. The object of this type of search is to help refine, narrow, and speed the searching process for finding relevant information, which would otherwise yield humanly unmanageable result sets. This search strategy is introduced to third year chemistry students in an information literacy workshop using SciFinder, Reaxys, and Web of Science Structure Search. The aim of the workshop is to help students develop hands-on familiarity on the use of chemistry databases and search strategies for scientific information retrieval. The "Imploded Boolean Search" adds a new skill set to a student's arsenal of search strategies. A survey and training exercise are used to assess the workshop. © 2015 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

In this study, a flipped classroom format was implemented and evaluated in the chemistry majors sequence at Purdue University over a period of three years. What was formerly lecture material was presented online outside of class time using videos of PowerPoint lectures with a voice-over. In-class time was devoted to collaborative problem solving based on the Student Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-Down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP) approach, which has been shown to increase student exam scores and passing rates. The purpose of this proof-of-principle study was to look at quantitative measures of student performance in the flipped versus the traditional lecture approach of this chemistry course. Three years of results using ACS standardized exams showed that students ACS general chemistry exam scores in the flipped class were significantly higher by almost one standard deviation when compared with the students previous scores in the traditional class. Analysis of open-ended surveys given to students at the end of the course showed that the majority of students responded positively to the format, listing a variety of benefits, drawbacks, and ways to improve that can inform future implementations. © 2015 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

The participants in the study were high school general chemistry students enrolled in two public schools with different demographics (School A and School B) in the Chattanooga, Tennessee, metropolitan area. Using a "treatment group" and a "control group" (no treatment), a mixed-methods design was used in the data collection and analysis to provide a holistic view of the impact of the software on student learning. The resulting qualitative and quantitative data confirmed that the software enhanced the treatment groups' conceptual and visual understanding of dimensional analysis. In fact, when all of the quantitative and qualitative data were viewed as a whole, the advantages of integrating use of the software into the general chemistry classroom proved to have significant impact on student conceptual and visual understanding of dimensional analysis. The enhanced conceptual understanding was verified by quantitative data, which indicated a significant difference between the overall pretest and posttest scores of the treatment group (n = 14, t = -2.896, p = 0.008). On the basis of the descriptive statistics, it is evident that all students benefited from using the software. The qualitative data showed that students' visual understanding was enhanced and that they valued their experiences using the software and were able to enhance their knowledge of all aspects of dimensional analysis. The researcher takes the lessons learned from this study and provides practical best practices on effectively integrating elements of the software to enhance conceptual and visual understanding in traditional chemistry classrooms. © 2013 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Facing highly competitive and changing environment, cultivating citizens with problem-solving attitudes is one critical vision of education. In brief, the importance of education is to cultivate students with practical abilities. Realizing the advantages of web-based cooperative learning (web-based CL) and creative problem solving (CPS) for learners in various aspects, many scholars have dedicated themselves to the study of CPS and Web-based CL. However, from a review of relevant literatures, it can be discovered that only a few of studies focus on the integration of CPS and Web-based CL. Thus, this study tried to integrate CPS and Web-based CL to the subject of accounting and explore the effects of this innovative teaching instruction on students' problem-solving attitudes. Aims: The study aimed to explore the effect of applying an innovative teaching strategy - creative problem solving strategy on web-based cooperative learning environment in accounting course to promote students' problem-solving attitudes. Sample: Students in three classes of the 4-year hotel management program were selected as research subjects. One class was assigned to the experimental group 1 (EG1), which was treated with 'creative problem solving (CPS) strategy on web-based cooperative learning (Web-based CL) method; another was assigned to the experimental group 2 (EG2), with 'Web-based CL' adopted; and the other was assigned to the control group (CG), with 'traditional lecturing' method adopted. Method: The quasi-experimental method was conducted, and the collected data was analyzed by quantitative methods. Results: The major results showed that the differences among the three classes reached the significant levels, and the problemsolving attitudes of the EG1 were significantly better than that of the EG2 and CG. Conclusion:Before the experimental teaching, students in the three groups had significant differences in their problem solving attitudes. After the experimental teaching, the post-test results revealed that the difference among three groups in problem solving attitudes reached significant level. EG1 had the highest performance. Moreover, EG1 had significantly outperformed EG2 and CG. However, no significant difference was observed between EG2 and CG.},

	abstract = {Sixty-five teams of basic and secondary school students solved problem-solving tasks during a virtual hike in a Web-based inquiry-learning simulation 'Hiking Across Estonia'. This environment provided learners with all necessary background information for problem-solving and tools for carrying out experiments. There were 25 tasks in certain order about ecological and environmental issues. The teams were clustered according to the data about participants, the results of the pre- and post-test, and their achievement in problem-solving tasks of the virtual hike. Only two out of five clusters were regarded as effective in solving problems and analysing tables, graphs, figures, and photos. The others had difficulties in forming contextual or task and process awareness. A support system for increasing the effectiveness of inquiry learning and enhancing their development of analytical skills was developed on the basis of the strategies that the members of five clusters had used in solving the problems, their achievement in solving the tasks during the virtual hike and in the pre- and post-test, and the personal data about the teams. The support system contained different notes before solving the problems and changed sequence of the tasks on the virtual hike for some clusters. The usage of this system was evaluated in a second study with 60 teams. The comparison of two studies demonstrated significant effectiveness of the support system to both general problem-solving ability and analytical skills. The characteristics of each cluster and the influence of the support system are discussed in this paper. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In an effort to increase the number of researchers with skills "in identifying and addressing the ethical, legal, and social implications of their research," the National Institutes of Health (NIH) solicited training grant proposals from 1999 to 2004 and subsequently funded approved programs. The authors describe the content, format, and outcomes of one such training program that ran from 2002 to 2006 and share key lessons learned about program formats and assessment methods.Jointly developed by the Saint Louis University Center for Health Care Ethics and the Missouri Institute of Mental Health Continuing Education department, the training program focused on mental health research and adopted a train-the-trainer model. It was offered in on-site and distance-learning formats. Key outcomes of the program included educational products (such as 70 case studies posted on the course Web site, a textbook, and an instructional DVD) and program completion by 40 trainees. Assessment involved pre- and posttesting focused on knowledge of research ethics, ethical problem-solving skills, and levels of confidence in addressing ethical issues in mental health research. The program succeeded in increasing participants' knowledge of ethical issues and their beliefs that they could identify issues, identify problem-solving resources, and solve ethical problems. However, scores on the case-based problem-solving assessment dropped in posttesting, apparently because of diminished confidence about the right course of action in the specific dilemma presented; the implications of this finding for ethics assessment are discussed. Overall satisfaction was high, and dropout rates were low but three times higher for distance-learners than for on-site participants. © 2008 Association of American Medical Colleges.},

Specifically, an organizational scenario is described to support introducing the PBL method of course delivery. This is based on an action research depiction on some of the experiences and issues involved in conceiving and developing a Web-based course-support environment called REAL (Rich Environment for Active Learning). Our case then deliberates on the idea of setting up a Center for PBL Research as an important mechanism of institutional innovation. This center could be considered as an essential effort to encourage individual organizational units within the university to provide suitable electronic services toward the realization of a virtual university. The dilemma of this effort, however, remains the emergent changes of organizational behavior in education, which is essentially subjective, eclectic, individual, context-specific, and often one-off, making it traditionally the most difficult to support with technology.

	abstract = {The principles, difficulties and challenges in control education are discussed and compared to the similar problems in the teaching of mathematics and systems science in general. The difficulties of today's students to appreciate the classical teaching of engineering disciplines, which are based on rigorous and scientifically sound grounds, are discussed. The new demands for modern engineering education assume that the mathematical skills of the students in modelling, analysis, synthesis, simulation and validation of control problems improve significantly, which sets a major challenge to the education system. To meet that challenge new activating teaching methods are needed, which together with traditional studies bring the students closer to practical applications. In the current paper two new teaching methods are presented, which are aimed at bringing the control world near the student more easily than the traditional courses do. These example cases are control courses in the net with self-study sections, interactive repetitive questions, problems with complete solutions (both pen and paper and computer problems). Also, new ‘interactive laboratory exercises’ have been included, where the students prepare their preliminary problems first, and after that test the controller with a real process over the net (from their home or from a computer class). © 2007, Copyright SEFI.},

	abstract = {Following the rationale that learning is an active process of knowledge construction as well as enculturation into a community of experts, we developed a novel web-based learning environment in bioinformatics for high-school biology majors in Israel. The learning environment enables the learners to actively participate in a guided inquiry process by solving a problem in the context of authentic research in genetics. Through the learning environment, the learners are exposed to a genetics problem which was developed on the basis of research in which a mutated gene, which causes deafness, was identified. They follow, step by step, the way scientists try to solve it, using the current geneticists' toolbox. The environment uses an adapted version of the BLAST program (a bioinformatics tool which enables to find similarities between sequences), which was modified in a way that enables the teachers and students to use it easily. Using quantitative and qualitative research approaches, we were able to show that learning through the bioinformatics environment promotes construction of new knowledge structures and influences students' acquisition of a deeper and multidimensional understanding of the genetics domain. In addition, learning through the bioinformatics environment influences students' comprehension of the practices and scientific ways of thinking.},

The methodology proposed could be useful in many other courses with a mathematical basis, particularly in engineering studies, in which students make extensive use of problem solving to lessen the level of abstraction present in the classroom. Students from a number of universities are currently using the tool, within the framework of a project that aims to improve the quality of learning.

	abstract = {This paper studies structured data extraction from Web pages, e.g., online product description pages. Existing approaches to data extraction include wrapper induction and automatic methods. In this paper, we propose an instance-based learning method, which performs extraction by comparing each new instance (or page) to be extracted with labeled instances (or pages). The key advantage of our method is that it does not need an initial set of labeled pages to learn extraction rules as in wrapper induction. Instead, the algorithm is able to start extraction from a single labeled instance (or page). Only when a new page cannot be extracted does the page need labeling. This avoids unnecessary page labeling, which solves a major problem with inductive learning (or wrapper induction), i.e., the set of labeled pages may not be representative of all other pages. The instance-based approach is very natural because structured data on the Web usually follow some fixed templates and pages of the same template usually can be extracted using a single page instance of the template. The key issue is the similarity or distance measure. Traditional measures based on the Euclidean distance or text similarity are not easily applicable in this context because items to be extracted from different pages can be entirely different. This paper proposes a novel similarity measure for the purpose, which is suitable for templated Web pages. Experimental results with product data extraction from 1200 pages in 24 diverse Web sites show that the approach is surprisingly effective, It outperforms the state-of-the-art existing systems significantly. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

The objective is to optimize the development process by introducing Learning Objects (LO) and Learning Object Classes (LO Classes) so that the content preparation can be separated from the educational issues, ergonomic design, and technical realization. Based on the concept of case-based, problem-oriented education, different learning scenarios were analysed and then modelled as different LOs. These LOs can be further abstracted in several reusable LO Classes that represent certain patterns of content structure, pedagogical concept, and user interface. With the help of LO input templates, the educational material can be prepared by the authors in the authoring process easily and appropriately. An LO content management system was developed to store and maintain different LOs and to generate the Web-presentation of LOs adaptively and dynamically in the tutoring process. This software framework has been applied to the exemplary development of an interactive course in orthopaedics. The LOs and LO Classes also help to maintain consistency of the course representation to users. As a result, more efficiency in the development phase and good usability and quality of the end products can be achieved. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.},

According to the proposed approach, incremental formalization can be achieved through the consideration of alternative projections of a collaborative workspace, as well as through mechanisms supporting the switching from one projection to another.

	abstract = {Spatial ability is one of the cognitive means used in problem solving activities particularly when manipulating and processing visuo-spatial information. With the increasing use of network communication, conventional teaching and learning has shifted towards the development of network environments, online learning, real-time interaction and high quality multi-user collaboration. This paper presents our experiment using a Web-based Virtual Environment (WbVE) that has improved a group of pre-service teachers' spatial ability understanding for teaching Engineering Drawing for secondary school subjects. The experiment is carried out in Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris (UPSI) comprising of 98 pre-service teachers taking the Computer Aided-Design (CAD) course. Selected subjects were pre-tested at the beginning of the semester with spatial tests focusing on mental rotation and spatial visualization to provide the baseline measurement. A desktop WbVE, which was employed and tested in the CAD laboratories to improve their spatial ability for five weeks of instructional treatment, will be demonstrated. Post-testing of spatial tests revealed significantly the overall spatial ability improvements as measured by the test scores. This paper concludes with a discussion on the impact of WbVE spatial learning that will be used as a precedent in the development of the VE teaching and learning prototypes for secondary school in Malaysia. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {This study examined how web-based integration and procedure question prompts differentially affected students' knowledge acquisition and ill-structured problem solving skills, particularly in representing problem(s), developing solutions, and monitoring and evaluating a plan of action within the social science context. Eighty-four undergraduate pre-service teachers were recruited and randomly assigned to one of the four conditions: (1) an IP condition that required students to complete integration prompts, (2) a PP condition that required students to complete procedure prompts, (3) an IPP condition that required students to complete both integration and procedure prompts, or (4) a control condition that did not provide access to any prompts. The findings show that students who received integration prompts outperformed those who did not receive any in knowledge acquisition and problem representation for solving an ill-structured problem. Integration prompts also helped the development and integration of cognitive schema, whereas procedure prompts helped direct students' attention to specific features of the problem in order to arrive at the solution(s). In fact, the presence of an integration prompt alone is not sufficient to support successful ill-structured problem solving unless a procedure prompt is provided. Based on these findings, this study offers implications for designing Web-based learning environments, engineered to promote integrative knowledge and ill-structured problem solving skills. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Complexity in nursing education has increased as it is challenged to meet the needs of diverse populations in rapidly evolving and highly technical health care settings. To accomplish or meet these societal wants, needs, and demands, nursing educators must prepare students successfully to become active, independent learners and problem solvers. The purpose of this study was to design a nursing course on the basis of scenario discussion, Web-based instruction (WBI), and the assessment of learning outcomes. The design of the study involved two stages. The first, beginning in 2001, developed the scenario discussion with the WBI system. The second evaluated learning outcomes within the context of a scenario discussion. Two instruments were examined in this study: a nursing assessment score and learning effectiveness survey. The target population in this study consisted of students enrolled in a two-year nursing program and registered for the course, Nursing I, during the fall semester of 2002. Using simple random sampling, 43 students were recruited and agreed to participate in the study. Most of the students chose “good” for learning effectiveness. Overall, the students gave higher learning effectiveness survey scores and nursing assessment scores. Due to their lack of previous exposure to scenario discussion, the students here felt frustration and anxiety while taking this course. Faculty should devote more time explaining the advantages of scenario discussion. In addition, in comparison with traditional teaching, Web-based instruction (WBI) imposes a heavier burden on the instructors and institutions involved. Nurse educators must continue to use innovative strategies to enhance student learning. Students registered both positive and negative feedback in open-ended questions on Web-based instruction. However in the future, special attention should be given to the learning software, Internet access speed, synchronous and asynchronous meetings, and the interaction interface. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

	abstract = {When teaching subjects richly infused with mathematics, in particular geometry, topology and shape modeling, there is a frequent problem that the learners are not able to "visualize" the attendant theoretical concepts. It is important, therefore, to constantly illustrate the associated theories with practical visual exercises, which are preferably to be done in collaboration with other learners to allow them to discuss possible approaches to the problem and to consult with the instructor, virtually or face-to-face. We have proposed an approach that would allow for solving mathematical problems while being immersed within shared virtual 3D collaborative environments. Only mathematical formulas are used by the learners for immediate interactive definition of geometry, appearance and physical property of the shapes being created in the virtual environment. We target learners and educators who are studying subjects rich in mathematics and geometry, or teaching them at the secondary or tertiary level or doing research on these topics. The process allows the learners to see and feel the geometric meaning of mathematics, thus making it less abstract and more perceptual and tangible. We also see ways of incorporating beneficial uses of immersive virtual environments into traditional courses at Universities which might benefit from 3D visualization. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased clinical demands and decreased available time accentuate the need for efficient learning in postgraduate medical training. Adapting Web-based learning (WBL) to learners' prior knowledge may improve efficiency. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that time spent learning would be shorter and test scores not adversely affected for residents who used a WBL intervention that adapted to prior knowledge. DESIGN: Randomized, crossover trial. SETTING: Academic internal medicine residency program continuity clinic. PARTICIPANTS: 122 internal medicine residents. INTERVENTIONS: Four WBL modules on ambulatory medicine were developed in standard and adaptive formats. The adaptive format allowed learners who correctly answered case-based questions to skip the corresponding content. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The measurements were knowledge posttest, time spent on modules, and format preference. One hundred twenty-two residents completed at least 1 module, and 111 completed all 4. Knowledge scores were similar between the adaptive format (mean±standard error of the mean, 76.2±0.9) and standard (77.2±0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] for difference -3.0 to 1.0, P=.34). However, time spent was lower for the adaptive format (29.3 minutes [CI 26.0 to 33.0] per module) than for the standard (35.6 [31.6 to 40.3]), an 18% decrease in time (CI 9 to 26%, P=.0003). Seventy-two of 96 respondents (75%) preferred the adaptive format. CONCLUSIONS: Adapting WBL to learners' prior knowledge can reduce learning time without adversely affecting knowledge scores, suggesting greater learning efficiency. In an era where reduced duty hours and growing clinical demands on trainees and faculty limit the time available for learning, such efficiencies will be increasingly important.

	abstract = {With the rapid development in Information Technology (IT), the Internet has become one of the central media for conducting learning. However, most of the existing web-based learning systems only provide stand-alone subject materials for browsing and may face some drawbacks. For example, if students encounter problems during the learning process, their learning performances could be significantly devastated due to no instant aid. As an on-line learning system may interact with thousands of students, it is almost impossible for the teachers or the teaching assistants to answer all the students' questions manually, which is not only inefficient, but also human laborious. To cope with this problem, an e-learning system that is able to automatically answer the students' questions on the fly based on the training cases given by the teacher will be presented in this paper. Moreover, an enhanced genetic approach is proposed to optimize the weights of keywords for each candidate answer according to the feedbacks provided by the students, hence more accurate answers can be provided in the future. Experimental results have shown that the developed system can provide more accurate answerers than existing approaches by employing the self-adjusting method. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The rapid development of computer and network technologies has attracted researchers to investigate strategies for and the effects of applying information technologies in learning activities; simultaneously, learning environments have been developed to record the learning portfolios of students seeking web information for problem-solving. Although previous research has demonstrated the benefits of applying information technologies to learning activities, the difficulties in doing so have also been revealed. One of the major difficulties is the lack of a mechanism to assist teachers in evaluating the problem-solving ability of the students, such that constructive suggestions can be given to the students, and tutoring strategies can be improved accordingly. To cope with this problem, in this paper, an auto-scoring mechanism is developed to analyze the various information searching abilities of individual students. Indicators of information searching ability (ISA) are proposed based on the famous Big6 model and are adopted in our auto-scoring mechanism. Moreover, two experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this innovative approach. The experimental results show high correlation between the scores of the auto-scoring mechanism and the manual scoring. Moreover, the feedbacks from 158 teachers also show that the innovative approach is highly accepted by the teachers. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A common idea is to build a large training set by analyzing the web content automatically. However, the noisy data is unavoidable involved in this kind of approach. In this paper, we present a novel web image annotation method based on noisy training set using Mixture Component based Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis (MLFDA). In our method, image annotation is viewed as a multiple class classification problem. To alleviate the influence of the noisy data, the separating hyper planes between different classes are learned by kernel-based local fisher discriminant analysis. Then the mixture components for each class are estimated in the subspace, where the noisy modals will gain small weights and play less important role in classification. The experimental results on a real-world web data set of 4000 images show that our method outperforms MBRM [3] and SVM-based method with F 1 measure improving 83% and 18% respectively. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {A computer-supported collaborative learning environment can enable students in web-based distance education courses to interact with each other and with one or more facilitators to conduct group work. Problem-based learning (PBL) is a learning theory that emphasizes the use of collaboration and teamwork to solve problems. However, a problem that occurs frequently in the implementation of PBL is the presence of passive students, usually students who have difficulty working in teams to solve problems. In face to face teaching, in classes of appropriate sizes, the facilitator can easily detect the presence of students with this profile and try to correct this situation to improve the learning process. In distance learning, however, this is not a trivial task, mainly due to issues related to the geographic distribution of students and the lack of information about their levels of motivation. Therefore, this paper presents a multiagent system for detecting passive students in PBL in virtual learning environments to detect and correct this undesired situation and improve the learning process. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

	abstract = {Multimedia data and application systems accessible over the Web are valuable assets for developing instructional materials for teaching, training, problem solving, and decision support. These assets can be used to construct learning objects, each of which is a reusable granule of instruction designed to meet a specific instructional objective. In order to find and use learning objects, an infrastructure for the registration, discovery, binding, and invocation of these objects is needed. Also, there is a need for an e-learning service infrastructure for people in a virtual e-learning community to construct, evaluate, and deliver learning objects. In this work, we model distributed and sharable learning resources by two types of Learning Objects (LOs): Atomic Learning Object and Composite Learning Object. Both types of LOs are published uniformly as Web services in a constraint-based broker in order to make them sharable and reusable. Tins article presents the learning object models for the specifications of these two types of LOs and an e-learning service infrastructure, which consists of authoring tools for constructing LOs, software components for processing LOs and performing assessments, and an extended Web services framework for the registration, discovery, binding, and invocation of LOs as Web services. This article also presents techniques such as dynamic binding of LOs, rule-based execution of learning processes, and model-based assessment used to make the processing of LOs active, flexible, customizable, and adaptive. The roles and functions of virtual e-learning community members are also discussed. Copyright © 2006, Idea Group Inc.},

The pathophysiology component included cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous and immune system diseases, while the pharmacology component was developed based on 150 commonly used drugs. One hundred and nineteen Year 1 nursing students took part in the course. The Web-based e-learning course materials were uploaded to a WebCT for students' self-directed learning and attempts to pass two scheduled online quizzes. At the end of the semester, students were given a questionnaire to measure the e-learning experience. Their experience in the e-learning course was a positive one. Students stated that they were able to understand rather than memorize the subject content, and develop their problem solving and critical thinking abilities. Online quizzes yielded satisfactory results. In the focus group interview, students indicated that they appreciated the time flexibility and convenience associated with Web-based learning, and also made good suggestions for enhancing Web-based learning. The Web-based approach is promising for teaching and learning pathophysiology and pharmacology for nurses and other healthcare professionals. © Copyright 2008, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {Current developments in Web-based learning are especially focusing on personalising learning by adapting the learning process to the student's prior knowledge, learning progress, learning goal, and possibly further characteristics. For creating personalised learning paths and efficiently uncovering the knowledge or competence level of a learner, prerequisite structures on learning objects and assessment problems, or on skills underlying those entities, are extremely useful. Knowledge Space Theory and its competence-based extensions provide a sound mathematical psychological framework that is based upon such prerequisite structures. Concept maps or semantic networks representing domain ontologies offer a valuable source of information for establishing prerequisite structures. This paper outlines approaches on the use of concept maps for deriving prerequisite relations and structures, which can subsequently serve as a basis for implementing personalisation and adaptivity in Web-based learning. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This paper begins by retrieving relevant blog articles, and then integrating a learning map as a dynamic social learning model. Because these retrieved blog articles pertain to course materials, they can be used to promote learner engagement in their interactions with a learning map and hence, achieve their goals more easily. An experimental course has been launched and the results show that learners do make use of the blog-based learning and can eventually cross the specified test thresholds. Lecturers using the proposed approach can apply the principles of dynamic learning in ways which not only reduce teacher workload, but also enhance student learning through the active construction of knowledge supported by alternative perspectives within meaningful blog contexts. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

	abstract = {Computer-based learning environments often confront learners with a number of tools, i.e. non-embedded support devices. Such environments assume learners to be good judges of their own learning needs. However, research indicates that students do not always make adequate choices for their learning process. This especially becomes an issue with the use of open learning environments, which are assumed to foster the acquisition of complex problem solving skills. Such open learning environments offer students tools to support their learning. Consequently, it is needed to understand factors that influence tool use and acquire insight in learning effects of tool use. Both issues are addressed in this contribution. A review of the existing literature has been undertaken by performing a search on the Web of Science and the PsycInfo database. Results indicate that there is some evidence for learner, tool and task characteristics to influence tool use. No clear indication was found for a learning effect of tool use. The conclusion proposes a research framework for the systematic study of tools. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

PBL is the learning which results from the process of working toward the understanding and resolution of a problem. The purpose of this study was to develop and implement problem-based learning in a digital logic course in a senior vocational industrial high school. Data collection included content analysis and a questionnaire survey. Content analysis was used to evaluate the students' discussion messages, quality of dialogue, and the level of problem-solving activities. A survey was then administered to examine the students' learning attitudes and perceptions toward this platform as a possible tool for PBL learning. Researchers found "Peer-responses" category is the most messages; the contents of messages focus on "General explanation" and "Reaction"; the level results of all groups' problem-solving are similar; the index of the "Interaction" satisfaction level is the highest in PBL activity. Finally, some research suggestions were also proposed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Currently, numerous on-line discussion forums have been developed for educational purposes; therefore, a better understanding about peer student discussion or discourse interactions is quite important. Through gathering peer learning interactions on 57 college computer science students, who were randomly assigned into 14 small groups for solving programming problems, this study analyzed the content of their discourse interactions. First, it was revealed that the most frequent interactions were related to some questions or suggestions regarding how to effectively coordinate peer members. However, different features of peer interactions were found across different small groups. By time sequence analysis of peer interactions, it was found that issues and positions were proposed mostly in the initial and middle stages of the study, while the conflicts frequently occurred in the beginning stage. Finally, this study suggested five peer interaction patterns in terms of peer knowledge exchange, including centralized knowledge exchange, distributive knowledge exchange, group development impediment, ability impediment and partial knowledge exchange. A further analysis of students' knowledge exchange patterns revealed that peer students' background abilities played an important role on the ways of knowledge exchange involved in the on-line peer learning activity. Certain configurations of students' background abilities tended to lead to a particular communication pattern. The implications derived from the findings for educational practice were also discussed. For example, the small groups with peer members of high achievement (or heterogeneous abilities) may not guarantee the success of group work. Many of them need teachers or moderators to scaffold the process of peer interactions and learning. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This methodology has been developed for the study of science subjects and, is currently being used in some European schools of secondary education, involving teachers and students. A Moodle platform has been developed to enforce the application and use of the methodology. Through this platform, teachers can monitor the progress of the work of the students and intervene when necessary as facilitators to provide further co-ordination, pose questions and suggest problem-based approaches. The use of the platform secures that the teacher remains distant from the students allowing students to work by themselves and find solutions to the problems posed. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Objectives. To promote independent self-study involving problem solving and decision analysis in the undergraduate medical curriculum, we have developed a series of interactive web-based clinical case studies. Methods. An initial needs assessment was performed to determine students' attitudes to e-learning. From these results we designed a series of 30 interactive case studies for delivery from a web-server. Results. A survey of 59 undergraduate students believed that online teaching resources were a useful supplement to existing teaching and they could see a positive use for e-learning. The interactive case studies program was well received by a broad range of respondents (n=84) of different abilities and backgrounds who felt that the program was realistic and clearly presented in an intuitive manner. Conclusions. The recent increases in numbers of medical undergraduates, the trend towards student-centred learning and the emphasis on patient-related teaching means a great pressure on teachers and resources in medical schools. The case studies program we have developed was effective and well received by both biomedical and medical students. This approach may provide a way to increase the exposure of students to clinical cases involving interactive diagnostic and treatment procedures, that mimic real-world scenarios, but with fewer resource implications. © 2006 Oxford University Press.},

Results indicated that gender, age, learning styles, time spent on the course, and perceptions of student-student interactions, course activities, and asynchronous Web-based conferences were not related to satisfaction and learning outcomes. Those students who entered the course with better Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) scores achieved higher final grades in the course, but did not express more satisfaction with the learning environment. Computer experience did not influence achievement but experienced computer users were more satisfied with the course. Students who perceived the student-instructor interactions positively felt that their discussion group had performed well during the conferences, and viewed the learning materials used in the conferences positively improved grades and were more satisfied with the course. Students expected instructor-led learning.

	abstract = {The management of the infrastructure and content of the World Wide Web is a growing problem for the development of web-based educational applications (WbEA) and is hidden beneath the tremendous benefits of the web. Moreover, such systems undergo more frequent and quite extensive changes in their development and operational period because the client's perception (either the learner, the teacher or institutional organisation) of the complete end product is a 'moving target'. So, there is a need for a disciplined approach to managing the evolution of web-based educational applications. Such a disciplined approach as applied throughout the software engineering process is called software configuration management (SCM). This paper begins a discussion of how the development of web-based educational applications could benefit from SCM techniques and tools and proposes a model for the management of the evolution of such systems. The model couples the development and evolution process of WbEA configurations into one framework, which seems promising for the implementation of a configuration management process. Also, the model focuses on the development of the web-based educational content, defining the configurations of the items involved in the underlying process. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the benefits of the use of this approach.},

Discourse chunking is a simple way to segment dialogues according to how dialogue participants raise topics and negotiate them. It has been used successfully to improve performance in dialogue act tagging, a classification taskwh ere utterances are classified according to the intentions of the speaker. Earlier worksh owed that discourse chunking improved performance on the dialogue act tagging taskwh en the chunk information was correct and hand-coded. The goal for the current study is two-fold: first, to investigate how accurately dialogues can be marked with discourse chunks automatically, and second, to determine the effect of the discourse chunk information on dialogue act tagging. We present evidence which shows that discourse chunking improves the performance of the dialogue act tagger, even when the chunkin formation is imperfect. The dialogue act tagger for this study uses case-based reasoning, a machine learning technique which classifies utterances by comparing their similarity to examples from a knowledge base. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.},

	abstract = {World Wide Web (Web)-based learning (WBL), problem-based learning (PBL), and collaborative learning are at present the most powerful educational options in higher education. A blended (hybrid) course combines traditional face-to-face and WBL approaches in an educational environment that is nonspecific as to time and place. To provide educational services for an undergraduate second-year elective course in acid-base physiology, a rich, student-centered educational Web-environment designed to support PBL was created by using Web Course Tools courseware. The course is designed to require students to work in small collaborative groups using problem solving activities to develop topic understanding. The aim of the study was to identify the impact of the blended WBL-PBL-collaborative learning environment on student learning outcomes. Student test scores and satisfaction survey results from a blended WBL-PBL-based test group (n = 37) were compared with a control group whose instructional opportunities were from a traditional in-class PBL model (n = 84). WBL students scored significantly (t = 3.3952; P = 0.0009) better on the final acid-base physiology examination and expressed a positive attitude to the new learning environment in the satisfaction survey. Expressed in terms of a difference effect, the mean of the treated group (WBL) is at the 76th percentile of the untreated (face-to-face) group, which stands for a "medium" effect size. Thus student progress in the blended WBL-PBL collaborative environment was positively affected by the use of technology. Copyright © 2005 The American Physiological Society.},

The new curriculum attempted to incorporate web-based technology, while preserving the historical emphasis on the use of peer trainers and the Small Group Activity Method (SGAM) to promote team problem solving and worker empowerment. Methods: The University of Michigan evaluated the program by administering a survey combining open- and closed-ended questions to trainees. Results: Of the 46 respondents, most rated the program very highly, found that the use of internet technology allowed faster access to current information, reported peer trainers as one of program aspects they liked best, and did not find working in groups of three per computer difficult. Conclusions: It is possible to enhance a workplace health and safety training program through the introduction of ATT without compromising participant-centered, group learning program philosophies. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Discriminant function analysis was used to analyze the influence of 14 variables on the dependent variable successful completion of Web-based classes at the community college level. Results of the quantitative analysis suggest that grade point average (GPA), study environment, age, time since last college class, and background preparation were significant discriminating factors. Using qualitative analysis, 22 randomly selected students who dropped their Web-based course were interviewed about their reasons for dropping the course. The reason given most often for dropout was that the student could not obtain, access, or install all the required learning materials in a timely manner and that they dropped the course while they still had a chance to do so. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

These examples are presented because they represent a wide range of strategies, genres, and goals for science inquiry.

However, WBI is making new types of errors of objectification and unification, which somewhat deviate from the basic education philosophy of constructivism.Jn this paper, we propose a preWBI system, which is subsidiary to WBI system and automatically builds basic knowledge for collaborative learning activity such as problem - solving and subject research studying. We have designed and implemented a preWBI system with Java applet. PreWBI provides useful help for WBI to build database with relevant knowledge, and furthermore it is useful and handy for instruction - learning activity. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

In this paper we discuss the design, implementation, and evaluation of MARVIN (Markup for Analogy Representation and Visualization for the InterNet), a Web-based system for representing, retrieving, and visualizing human-conceived analogies that provides a medium and a common language for analogy practitioners to share their analogies. We developed a compact XML content model for analogy expressions for use in Web-based environments, and show that the model is capable of representing a wide range of human-conceived analogies. We demonstrate, using XSLT, several example methods for visualizing analogy expressions that use our model. We demonstrate methods for storing and retrieving such expressions and for ranking the retrieved expressions. We designed and implemented MARVIN to demonstrate these methods. A formative evaluation of the MARVIN system found that its visualization and retrieval capabilities are of value to analogy authors and end users. A performance test showed that MARVIN's analogy retrieval is scalable to large analogy archives.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to discuss major issues in designing inquiries on the web. Instructional designers face a lot of difficulties and challenges to deal with in the course of designing inquiry experiences for learners in the online environment, a complex and ill-structured learning environment. Facilitating inquiry or using an inquiry-based learning approach on the web has both advantages and disadvantages. Instructional designers need to acknowledge the design issues arising in each and every phase of the design process, Utilising appropriate design strategies, instructional designers can provide positive learning experiences for their online learners. For this purpose, three representative cases in the context of teacher professional development were examined and six major issues were identified as follows: (1) seeking a balance between a system-generated guide and human facilitator, (2) visual representation of the inquiry process, (3) motivating learners with the right question, (4) engaging learners in various learning activities, (5) guiding the inquiry process with various scaffolds, and (6) maximising learning by coordinating resources, tools and the community of inquiry. This study explains each issue in great detail and provides possible guides for instructional designers to handle the issue.},

These modules were first developed using an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) authoring tool and animation tools. After the concept was proved positively, a Web-based ITS was developed to incorporate both modules. The authoring tool-based ITS timer modules were evaluated with 90 undergraduate manufacturing engineering students in 2002. The Web-based ITS timer and counter modules were evaluated by 38 undergraduate students in 2003. In both cases, students made statistically significant learning gains as a result of taking the modules, and rated the modules positively in terms of ease of use and understanding, clear objectives, amount of interaction, ability to motivate, relevance, and pace.},

This need is driven by the overwhelming amount of information currently available on appropriate drug usage, by a proliferation of new biotechnology-derived pharmacologic agents, and by an expanded prescribing authority that is being granted to health professionals who have not traditionally had this responsibility and training. This discussion emphasizes the points that (a) the technology is available to share the best teaching materials for clinical pharmacology over the Internet, (b) clinical pharmacology organizations are best positioned to facilitate this exchange of educational materials, and that (c) continued discourse about problem-based learning and other curricular approaches to teaching clinical pharmacology is essential. The currently available information on the Internet includes case studies, slide sharing for lectures, educational programs and educational software. Clinical pharmacology organizations are not only starting to organize this information, but also to review the content of these programs and continuously add new material. These organizations have also developed a powerful tool through their journals in which to present educational series on rational therapeutics and to discuss educational approaches to instruction. Teaching forums, such as those presented annually at the American College of Clinical Pharmacology Annual Meeting, are essential to encourage discussion about teaching clinical pharmacology in the broadest context of the therapeutics, the economics and the legal aspects of clinical drug use.},

	abstract = {A generic interactive multimedia e-leaming system (IMELS) for industrial engineering that uses a problem-based learning approach is developed. The system is designed to be a learning shell with an open architecture for the hosting and delivery of knowledge, case problems and other web-based material in industrial engineering. This problem-based e-learning system is designed to revitalize the teaching/learning process of industrial engineering and to create a learning platform that overcomes the boundaries of space and time. A number of configurable modules are introduced, including a multimedia introduction to industrial engineering, an electronics knowledgebase, and a platform that facilitates interactive problem-based learning through realistic case problems. As the principal objectives of the system are to use the computer-based materials with conventional teaching, and as an up-to-date repository for practitioners in the field, an architecture that accommodates flexible re-configuration, building-up of new information and updating existing materials is provided. This paper presents the design of the IMELS with special focuses on the architecture of the 'virtual company' that supports the problem-based learning paradigm, facilitates dynamic reconfiguration and tracking of student learning activities. © 2005 TEMPUS Publications.},

	abstract = {The task-oriented proactive seamless migration is one of difficult problems to be solved in pervasive computing paradigm. Apparently, this function of seamless mobility is suitable for mobile services, such as mobile Webbased learning. But when seamless migration for computing task of learning is realized among PC, laptop, or PDA, there are several difficult problems to be solved, such as how to supply the proactive/attentive service with uncertainty for aware context. In order to realize E-learning based on proactive seamless migration, we design and improve relative fuzzy-neural approach (of course, besides it, there are other approaches). Generally, the network can be classified into two. One is that fuzzy logic reasoning is completed by fuzzy weight in neural system. The other is that the input data must be fuzzified in the first or second level, but not weight. We discuss and study the second in this paper. For proactive decision, fusion method based on fuzzy-neural can make Web-based learning system keep advantage of fuzzy logic system and remain adaptive optimum in proactive/attentive service. The correctness and validity of our new approach have been tested. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

In the seminars, managers from participating companies work in teams on multiple-step problem analysis and solution strategies, supported by workplace coaches. The teams also interact with each other so that peer learning is stimulated. To extend the BOSNO management seminar model in both depth and flexibility, a new approach called e-BOSNO was designed in which a web-based learning support environment played a critical role. This paper describes the e-BOSNO design process and gives results from the first cycle of e-BOSNO. The results showed the participants to be much more active and interactive than in previous e-BOSNO seminars, even though there were fewer face-to-face meetings. Workplace-oriented learning occurred and was shared in a way which makes it available for reuse in subsequent e-BOSNO seminars.},

An appropriate solution to the sense division problem is usually dependent on the application being pursued. In the context of machine translation, picking the correct translation for a word among multiple candidates, is known as target word selection. The work in this paper uses the Web as the main knowledge source to address the difficulty of making a target word selection based on statistics, which are normally drawn from rather limited corpora. The proposed approach uses simple and easily accessible web statistics-search engine hits (number of document returned for a particular query) to demonstrate the great potential of the Web as a knowledge source for word sense disambiguation. Our experimental results so far are very encouraging. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	abstract = {The recent development of the computer network technology has brought us many benefits including the electronic business. But also, one serious side effect is the explosive increase of the unauthorized computer access, and it becomes a big social problem. Of course, there are many security solutions in the market, but they cannot stop such intrusions or reduce the damages resulting from such accident. Besides, the protection of the system requires significant amount of the budget. Therefore, we need to think of minimizing damages or avoiding from the intrusions. One possible solution might be providing a training system to the system managers who are in charge of maintaining and protecting the servers. In this paper, we are suggesting a simulated security training system in the virtual learning environment. The system is being built based on the ITS structure primarily, and mainly focused on providing the simulated security exercises adaptively. For instance, since the system maintains the solution paths, the student’s problem solving steps are monitored and being interrupted with advising messages when necessary. It is designed as a client/server environment, so the student needs only the web browser to access the system. And the student can execute the selected task in the Java applet based virtual OS environment according to the learning scenario. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

	abstract = {Utilization of the virtual classroom as a laboratory for teaching and learning experimentation has increased significantly in recent years as development tools for Web-based applications have become easier to use, and computers have become more capable and less expensive. But, does the virtual classroom improve student learning? Herein we describe the results of two experiments conducted on sections of an Engineering Economy course (ISE 2014) at Virginia Tech during the Spring 2000 and Fall 2000 semesters. The two experiments were designed to determine if student learning of Engineering Economy was significantly affected by two treatments: 1) An industrial team project provided by General Electric (GE) in the Spring and Fall of 2000, and 2) Web-based supplemental course materials in the Fall of 2000. The actual final scores of students in the experimental and control sections were compared (for the Spring and Fall experiments) in order to determine the impact on learning of the project and/or the Web-based support. Results show that required team-based industrial projects, such as those offered by GE, improve learning by allowing students to integrate the principles of engineering economy during actual problem solving activity. Results for the Fall semester indicated that the Web-based supplements to the course did not affect student performance. Copyright © Institute of Industrial Engineers.},

	abstract = {Advances in information communication technology (ICT) require new paradigms in every aspect of our society. In this sense, schools are responsible for educating students to solve real-world problems with ICT. However, schools have not provided quality education to students for learning ICT and applying it. It is thus necessary to develop an ICT instruction model for students. One of the popular instruction models for Web-based instruction is the project-based model (NetPBL). It is a student-centered model in which students take initiative in all study processes. The model includes inquiry activities of areas, such as subjects, problems, and issues, and presentation activities of study results. The model also encourages interactions among students for achieving common goals. In this paper, we present an instruction model called Web-based instruction model for ICT (WICT) which provides four major enhancements to the existing project-based model. First, our model emphasizes learners’ autonomy and helps them perform diverse learning activities. Second, learners can decide the learning objectives and strategies for themselves, and participate in the evaluation process of their study results. Third, by experiencing active information sharing and interactions, learners can acquire information communication ethics such as the utilization of sound information, network communication etiquette, and copyright protection. Fourth, learners can develop their creativity and problem solving abilities in the process of finding proper information, analyzing it, and eventually creating new information for their objectives. We then present the implementation of our proposed model in an example application of elementary school’s social study courses. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

It was designed during the development of CBR systems used at NEC. Multilink retrieval provides a method for searching a case library from several viewpoints. Question selection by entropy finds most effective questions in discriminating cases. It does this by calculating the information gain of candidate questions. Indexing with scripts is a case-indexing method using Schank's scripts and is effective when situations and problems are hard to express and assess. ExpertGuide tightly integrates these techniques and provides a user interface for users who want advice from mentors. It is currently being used when building WWW-based mentor systems with scales ranging from division-wide to corporate-wide and nationwide.},

To decrease the burden of on-line learning, it is important to seek suitable structures to represent user information needs. This paper proposes a model for information filtering on the Web. The user information need is described into two levels in this model: profiles on category level, and Boolean queries on document level. To efficiently estimate the relevance between the user information need and documents, the user information need is treated as a rough set on the space of documents. The rough set decision theory is used to classify the new documents according to the user information need. In return for this, the new documents are divided into three parts: positive region, boundary region, and negative region. An experimental system JobAgent is also presented to verify this model, and it shows that the rough set based model can provide an efficient approach to solve the information overload problem.},
